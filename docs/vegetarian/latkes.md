# Latkes

## Ingredients
500 grams floury potatoes, washed, with skins left on  
1 large onion, or 2 shallots  
2 eggs  
1 tablespoon cornflour  
Salt, to taste  
Black pepper, to taste  
Oil, for frying

## Directions
In a food processor (using the fine grating plate) or on the coarse side of a box grater, grate the onions and potatoes.  
In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and cornflour together, adding a large pinch of salt to season.  
Use a clean tea towel to squeeze as much moisture out of the onions and potatoes as humanly possible. (Easiest to do this in batches.)  
Stir the dry vegetables into the egg and cornflour mixture. Season well and mix by hand.

In a shallow (preferably cast iron) frying pan, heat up about 5mm deep of oil until hot, but not smoking. Spoon the latke mix into the pan, pressing each one down so theyâ€™re not too thick. Cook for a few minutes on each side until brown and crisp.  
Use a slotted spoon to remove the cooked latkes, and transfer to a rack to stay crisp while the rest of them are cooked.  
Serve hot, garnished as you prefer.

## My Notes
If you make extra, they seem to retain crispiness best if frozen immediately. To reheat, put frozen pancakes onto a baking tray in a preheated oven, about 15 minutes in our fan-assisted oven at 200C (400F) works for us. We prefer these with sour cream alongside.

One time I made these, I used 2kg of potatoes and 1kg of onions, and 4 eggs. It made about 24 latkes, with most frozen for another meal.

Iâ€™ve also used 2kg potatoes, 2 carrots, and 3 tablespoons flour to make eggless latke. Seasoned with garlic powder. It worked okay, they fell apart a little easier but tasted great. ðŸ™‚
