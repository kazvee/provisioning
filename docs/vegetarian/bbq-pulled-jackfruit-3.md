# Slow Cooker BBQ Pulled Jackfruit

## Ingredients
1.5 cups vegetable stock  
6 ounces (usually 1 can) tomato paste  
1/4 cup brown sugar  
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar  
1 tablespoon molasses (can substitute maple syrup)  
2 cloves fresh garlic, finely chopped  
2 teaspoons smoked paprika  
1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder  
2 x 20 ounce (approx 565 grams / 550 ml) cans young green jackfruit in brine or water, drained

## Directions
Drain and rinse the jackfruit. Remove the core, if you want, however the core is edible so you may prefer to just separate them, and chop them into small bits!  
Mix stock, tomato paste, brown sugar, vinegar, molasses, garlic and spices in slow cooker. Add jackfruit. Mix well and cook on Low for 8 hours, or High for 4 hours, stirring once at the halfway point. When done, shred jackfruit in cooker and serve.

## My Notes
I skipped the tomato paste since I used more than the required amount of barbecue sauce, just to finish the bottle. I also added about 14.5 ounces (approx 400 g) of  chopped canned tomato. I used the High setting so it wouldnâ€™t take as long, and propped the slow cooker lid open for the last hour of cooking, to thicken up the sauce.
