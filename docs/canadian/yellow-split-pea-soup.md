# Qu√©b√©cois-Style Yellow Split Pea Soup with Bacon
Servings: 12

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
2 litres (8 cups) water (or broth)  
1 lb (about 1.75 cups) dried yellow split peas, sorted and rinsed  
3 medium carrots, diced (1.5 cups)  
1 medium onion, chopped (1/2 cup)  
1 medium stalk celery, chopped (1/2 cup)  
1 cup (5 oz) bacon, diced  
4 cloves garlic, chopped  
2 bay leaves  
1 teaspoon savoury  
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves  
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, crumbled  
1/2 teaspoon pepper  
3/4 teaspoon salt (if needed! If you use broth, it may already contain salt!)

## Directions
Add all ingredients to slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low setting for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 6 hours, until peas and vegetables are tender. Adjust seasoning as needed. Either use an immersion blender (carefully!) to blend the soup to desired thickness right in the slowcooker itself, or decant 2 cups of the soup at a time into a blender or food processor, cover and blend on Medium speed until all the soup has been blended. 

## My Notes
My onions and bacon were already cooked ahead of time. I used 8 cups of water, 3 chicken stock cubes (mine say 1 cube per 500ml water), and 3/4 of a vegetable stock cube I had leftover from something else. I cooked on high for 6 hours and blended with my metal immersion blender. I doubled the amount of carrots so it looks pretty orange. I didn‚Äôt add any salt, because I figured the bacon and stock cubes had enough salt already. This made 12 portions, and freezes well. Apparently dried green split peas can be used instead, too.
