# Boller i Karry – Meatballs in Curry Sauce

## Ingredients for Meatballs
300 grams ground pork  
3/4 teaspoon salt  
1 egg  
1 onion, finely chopped  
100 ml milk  
4 tablespoons flour  
1/4 ground pepper (or to taste)  
1 1/2 teaspoons water

## Ingredients for Curry Sauce
20 grams butter  
1/2 onion  
3 teaspoons mild curry powder  
2 1/2 tablespoons flour  
600 ml boiling water from meatballs or chicken stock  
4 teaspoons double cream (or plain yoghurt)

## Directions for Meatballs
Mix the ingredients for the meatballs together, form into meatballs and chill them in the fridge for an hour or so.  
When ready to cook, boil the meatballs for 10 minutes or so until cooked through. Remove from the boiling water with a slotted spoon and retain the water to make the curry sauce with.

## Directions for Curry Sauce
In a large pan, melt the butter, add the flour and whisk until smooth. Add the curry powder and onion. Add the leftover meatball water and bring to a boil.  
Reduce heat and add the cream/yoghurt (be careful that the mixture isn’t too hot, or the yoghurt will split.) Add the meatballs to the sauce. Salt and pepper to taste.

## My Notes
I prefer making the meatballs and frying them because I’m worried my meatballs will fall apart in the water. I use 1 chicken or beef stock cube added to 600 ml water instead of the reserved meatball stock.  
This freezes and doubles well. I’ve also added extra spices sometimes, like asafoetida, tumeric, and sumac.
