# Jeera Rice - Cumin Rice
Serves: 2

## Ingredients
1 cup rice (175 grams)  
1 cup water (240 ml = 240 grams)  
1/2 to 1 tablespoon ghee / clarified butter  
1/2 to 1 tablespoon oil (I used sunflower oil)  
1 to 3 teaspoons jeera / cumin seeds  
Salt to taste (I used 1/2 teaspoon)

## Directions
Rinse the rice until water runs clear. Drain and place into rice cooker with enough water to cook it. (Amounts can vary depending on the type of rice you use, the measurements above are what worked for me.) If youâ€™re using Basmati rice, soak it for 30 minutes beforehand.

When ready to cook the rice, first heat the ghee and oil in a small pan on the hob. When the oil is hot enough, add the cumin seeds and let them crackle and turn brown.
Once the seeds are browned, pour the mixture from the pan into your rice cooker on top of the rice. Add salt to taste, stir and start the rice cooker. When done, fluff and serve.

## My Notes
I only used the minimum amounts of ghee, oil, and cumin since I was trying it for the first time. It was nice but more cumin next time would be good. ðŸ™‚ Will make again.

**Other ideas:**  
Try with 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of nigella seeds / kalonji and 1 teaspoon of grated or minced ginger.

## Microwave
Weâ€™ve also had success melting ghee for 1/2 a minute in the microwave on High. Then, add in the cumin seeds and heat another 1/2 â€“ 1 minute on High, until the seeds have darkened and become fragrant.
