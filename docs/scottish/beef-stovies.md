# Beef Stovies
Serves: 4
Total Cooking Time: 55 mins (Prepare: 15 mins, Cook: 40 mins)

## Ingredients
300 g cooked beef, diced  
1 tablespoon sunflower oil  
1 knob of butter  
1 kg white potatoes, thinly sliced  
1 large onion, thinly sliced  
450 ml beef stock  
freshly grated nutmeg  
4 tablespoons finely chopped parsley or chives

## Directions
Heat the oil and butter in a large pan and layer up the potatoes, onion and beef, seasoning and sprinkling with nutmeg and herbs as you go.  
Pour over the stock, cover and cook for 30 â€“ 40 minutes, shaking the pan from time to time until the potatoes are cooked through (the ones at the bottom with be soft and the ones at the top, just tender).  
Sprinkle over some herbs and black pepper and serve.

## My Notes
I hate nutmeg, so I did not use any. Still, this turned out really nice! I used 3 Oxo cubes to make the broth so the stock was a bit stronger, and the potatoes were sliced about 1/2 cm thick.
