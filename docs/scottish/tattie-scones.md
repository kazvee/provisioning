# Scottish Potato Scones

## Ingredients
225 grams (1/2 lb) starchy/floury potatoes (see notes), boiled, drained, and mashed  
65 grams (2.5 oz) plain or all-purpose flour  
25 grams (1 oz) butter  
1/4 teaspoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
Pepper, pinch or to taste

## Directions
In a medium pan, boil the potatoes in salted water until tender enough for mashing. Drain and mash them in a bowl with the butter, salt, pepper, and baking soda.  
Mix in the flour to make a stiff dough. Depending on the type of potatoes used, you may need to add a bit more flour.  
Roll out your dough onto a floured surface, flattening it to about 5 mm to 6 mm thick.  
Cut the dough into rounds (using a small plate as a guide, if needed) and then slice into 4 equal sized wedges.  
Prick the slices all over with a fork, and fry in a lightly greased frying pan or griddle on meium heat for about 3 minutes for each side, until theyâ€™re golden brown.

## My Notes
My husband really enjoys tattie scones so I wanted to see if I could make homemade ones. I used margarine instead of butter. I weighed the potatoes unpeeled, and then used the rest of the potatoes in the house, and I didnâ€™t want to peel them and end up with underweight ingredients. They did tend to tear apart a bit because of the potato peel left in them, but it wasnâ€™t too much of a problem!  
I didnâ€™t shape them with a saucer, I just divided the dough in half and then each half made a decent size round that I then sliced into 4 wedges.  
The cooked product seemed robust enough to be cooked in bulk and put in the freezer (separated by greaseproof paper, probably) to be toasted from frozen at a later date. Further research needed! ðŸ˜‰

Some recipes call for an egg to be added (or for my recipe above, probably only 1/2 an egg but do your own research for proportions for this!) which apparently results in a lighter, fluffier, more pancake-ish dough. I might try it at some point, if I decide to make a few bulk batches for freezing.

Iâ€™ve read that the potatoes used should be a starchy variety (so King Edward or Maris Piper, or russet potatoes if you canâ€™t find the first two). Make sure the type you buy is suitable for mashing.
