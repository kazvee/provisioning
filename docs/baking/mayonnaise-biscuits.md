# Easy Mayonnaise Biscuits
Makes: 6 biscuits

## Ingredients

1 cup self-rising flour (or all-purpose flour PLUS 1.5 teaspoons baking powder and a pinch of salt)  
1/2 cup milk  
1/4 cup mayonnaise

## Directions
Stir the flour, milk, and mayonnaise together in a bowl until you have a smooth mixture. Pour into 6 pre-greased muffin cups. Bake in an oven preheated to 190C / 375F for 30 minutes, until golden brown.

## My Notes

I spotted this recipe and it struck me as a bit weird to make biscuits with mayonnaise. So of course I had to try it! ðŸ¤“

If you don't have self-rising flour, you can substitute all-purpose flour, but you'll also need to sift in 1.5 teaspoons baking powder and a pinch of salt to the flour before you stir in the milk and the mayo.

I used all purpose flour, so added the baking powder and salt as per the notes above. I didn't use a muffin tin, I just dropped the dough onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. I didn't use "real mayonnaise" for this, just a generic "whipped dressing" type of mayo.  
We didn't notice any taste of mayonnaise in these. I prefer my usual sourdough biscuits, but might make this recipe again the next time I want something quick and easy.
