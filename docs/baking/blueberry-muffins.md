# Wholemeal Blueberry Muffins
Makes: 12

## Ingredients
2 very ripe large bananas  
300 grams wholemeal flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda  
pinch of fine sea salt  
100 grams light muscavado or brown sugar  
284 ml buttermilk or semi-skimmed milk  
1 large egg, lightly beaten  
75 grams light olive oil (or melted butter)  
200 grams blueberries, rinsed and drained  
1 tablespoon demerara sugar

## Directions
Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/Gas Mark 4. Line a 12-hole muffin tin with muffin cases. Peel the bananas and mash in a bowl using a fork.

Mix the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and brown sugar together in a bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the buttermilk, egg, oil and bananas. Fold together just enough to mix well. Tip in the blueberries and stir once or twice.

Spoon the batter into the muffin cases and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for about 20-25 minutes or until well-risen and golden brown on top; a skewer inserted into the centre of the muffin should emerge clean.

Leave to cool in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
