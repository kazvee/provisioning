# Butterscotch Chip Cookies with Cinnamon
Makes: 36 cookies

## Ingredients
213 grams (1 cup) brown sugar, packed  
99 grams (1/2 cup) granulated sugar (**My Notes:** I will try half the sugar next time!)  
1 cup butter, softened  
2 eggs  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
2.5 cups flour  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (**My Notes:** I think I doubled this.)  
1 bag (311 grams / 11 ounces) butterscotch chips  

## Directions
In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream together butter, both types of sugar, and vanilla extract. Use medium speed for about 2 minutes, until it‚Äôs fluffy and well-combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well.

In a medium bowl, sift your flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Add the dry mixture gradually to the wet mixture, using the low speed of your blender.
Fold in the butterscotch chips. Cover and refrigerate your dough overnight or at least for 30 ‚Äì 45 minutes.

When ready to bake, prepare a baking sheet (grease or parchment paper), and scoop 1 heaping tablespoon of batter at a time onto the sheet. You want them about 2 inches apart. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F for 10 to 12 minutes, until slightly golden around the edges. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes or so before removing them from the baking sheet.

## My Notes
I fit about 12 cookies on the baking sheet at a time, and these took about 10 min longer in my oven. We really, really liked these! üòç
