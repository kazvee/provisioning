# Apple & Cinnamon Muffins

## Ingredients
275 grams (10 oz) plain flour  
1 level teaspoon baking powder  
75 grams (3 oz) caster sugar  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
2 medium eggs  
225 ml (8 fl oz) milk  
110 grams (4 oz) butter, melted  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
225 grams (8 oz) cooking apples, peeled and chopped  
1 teaspoon cinnamon

## Topping
2 tablespoons Demerara sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamon

## Directions
Preheat oven to 200 C/400 F/Gas Mark 6.    
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.  
In a separate bowl, mix together sugar, eggs, milk, butter and vanilla extract.  
Fold flour mixture into egg mixture, add apple and cinnamon and mix gently to form a lumpy batter.  
Bake for 25 – 30 min until well risen and golden.

## My Notes
I usually don’t bother with the topping. For the batter, I double the cinammon. I have also used raisins instead of apple pieces and had great results!
