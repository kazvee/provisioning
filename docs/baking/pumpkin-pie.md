# Pumpkin Pie
Makes one 9" pie

## Ingredients
9 oz shortcrust pastry  
2 eggs, lightly beaten  
8 oz (425 g) can Libbyâ€™s Solid Pack Pumpkin  
6 oz granulated sugar  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  
1/2 pint Carnation Evaporated Milk

## Directions
Preheat oven to 220C / 425F / Gas Mark 7. Roll out pastry to line a 9 inch, deep flan tin. Chill. Bake blind for 10-15 minutes. Reduce oven to 180C / 350F / Gas Mark 4.

Combine filling ingredients together and pour into pastry case. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool.

## My Notes
I bought 2 sweet premade pastry pie shells from Asda, and this recipe filled both of them. I think I doubled the amount of cinnamon, too. It maybe took a bit longer than stated in my oven. It turned out really nice!
