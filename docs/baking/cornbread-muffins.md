# Cornbread Muffins
Makes: 12 muffins

## Ingredients
120 grams dry polenta or cornmeal  
125 grams plain flour  
5 tablespoons caster sugar  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 egg, beaten  
4 tablespoons rapeseed oil  
250 ml milk

## Directions
In a large bowl, sift flour, polenta, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a smaller bowl or measuring jug, beat the egg and add in the oil and milk, stirring to combine. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and stir gently until combined. Take care not to overmix. Let the batter rest for 5 – 10 minutes, then pour into a pre-greased (or paper-lined) muffin tin and bake in an oven preheated to 200C / 400F / Gas Mark 6 for 15 to 10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.

## My Notes

**1st attempt:**  
I halved the recipe (but still used 1 whole egg). Instead of milk, I used buttermilk substitute (poured 1 tablespoon white vinegar into a measuring jug and then added milk until the 125 ml mark, and then let it sit for 10 minutes.)  
After letting the batter sit for about 5 minutes, I added in about 1/4 cup of grated mature yellow cheddar, some freshly-ground black pepper, and some sea salt and red chili flakes from one of those spice combo grinder things.  
I used 6 ungreased silicone muffin cups, placed onto a metal baking tray. Took 17 minutes in my oven. 

**2nd attempt:**
Made the full 12 muffins this time, didn’t add the sugar or any shredded cheese. turned out nice but seemed a bit more dry than the first time. Might be worth trying with 2 eggs for the full recipe next time.
