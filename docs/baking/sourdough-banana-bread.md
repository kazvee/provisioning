# Sourdough Banana Bread

## Ingredients
375 grams of overripened bananas (weigh them with the skin on, it'll be about 2 medium-sized bananas)  
225 grams (1.25 cups lightly packed) light or dark brown sugar  
1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract  
2 large eggs  
100 grams (about 1/2 cup) of bubbly, active 100% hydration sourdough starter (Note: I used discard and it was fine, too!)  
250 grams (2 cups) all-purpose flour  
1.5 teaspoons baking soda  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
125 ml (1/2 cup) neutral flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc.)  
60 ml (1/4 cup) milk

## Directions
Using a hand blender or stand mixer with paddle attachment, blend the bananas, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl. It's fine to leave some small chunks of banana.

Add in the eggs, one at a time, and blend well. Add in the sourdough starter (or discard). In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Then add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, working in batches. Pour in the milk and oil, and stir until it's just combined. Take care not to overmix or the banana bread will be tough. (**Note:** I used my hand blender on low to mix in the milk and oil.)

Pour the batter into pre-greased pans (you can use three 7x3x2-inch mini loaf pans, or one single 9×5-inch loaf pan).  
Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 360F for 45 minutes (if using the mini loaf pans) or 60-65 minutes (for the standard 9×5-inch loaf pan), until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Towards the end of the baking time, if you feel the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, you can cover it with some aluminium foil.

Once done, let the banana bread cool in the tin for 20 minutes or so, then remove it and let it finish cooling on a wire rack.

## My Notes
I used my 9×13-inch glass casserole dish for this, and it took 50 minutes in my oven. This made a lot, so I've wrapped pairs of slices in clingfilm and then into a tupperware, and frozen the extra for later.

We enjoyed this recipe! I didn't notice any sourdough taste, and it's a great way to use my starter discard!
