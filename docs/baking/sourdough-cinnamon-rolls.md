# Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls with Mocha Chocolate Frosting

## Ingredients for the Dough
1/2 cup (123 grams) milk, room temperature  
1 3/4 cup (224 grams) all-purpose flour (can use up to 1/4 cup (33 grams) more if needed)  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
2 tablespoons butter, room temperature  
2 tablespoons white sugar  
1 cup (between 227 ‚Äì 241 grams / approx 8 to 8 1/2 ounces) sourdough starter (discard or fed)  
salt, pinch

## Directions for the Dough
Combine all ingredients and mix well (for about 5 minutes) to get a smooth, moist sticky dough. (If it‚Äôs too wet or sticky, you can up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed.)
Put the dough into a large pregreased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 3 to 5 hours.  
When ready to make the rolls, dust your working surface lightly with flour and roll out the dough to a rectangle shaped about 12 inches by 18 inches.

## Ingredients for the Filling
3 tablespoons butter, melted and allowed to cool  
1/3 cup (67 grams) brown sugar  
2 teaspoons cinnamon  
4 teaspoons instant coffee granules, crushed finely (optional)

## Directions for the Filling
Spread the melted butter onto the dough, to ensure it‚Äôs evenly covered. Then blend the cinnamon and brown sugar (and coffee granules, if using) together and sprinkle evenly across your dough surface.

Roll up the dough, starting on the longest side, to get a large cylinder, making sure to arrange the seam on the bottom. Slice into 9 ‚Äì 12 rolls, and arrange them into a pregreased baking tray. Let them rise in a warm place for 1 ‚Äì 2 hours, until puffy.  
Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F for 25 minutes, until the tops are lightly golden.

## Ingredients for the Mocha Chocolate Frosting
1 tablespoon cocoa powder (unsweetened)  
2 tablespoons butter  
1 tablespoons milk  
2 teaspoons instant coffee granules  
3/4 cup icing sugar  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions for the Mocha Chocolate Frosting
Using a hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Then add in cocoa powder, coffee granules, vanilla extract and milk. Mix well until you get a smooth icing. (You can add more icing sugar or milk as needed to adjust the thickness).  
Use this to frost the cinnamon rolls once they‚Äôve cooled. (If you want to store the rolls for a bit longer, leave them unfrosted and store the icing in the fridge. Frost them one at a time just before serving.)

## Option for Vanilla Frosting:
85 grams (3 oz) cream cheese, room temperature  
57 grams (1/4 cup) butter, room temperature  
188 grams (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (confectioners‚Äô sugar), sifted  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
salt, pinch

## My Notes
**1st attempt:**  
I used margarine, about 226 grams of my sourdough starter (100% hydration). I gave the dough the longest possible rise times (5 hours and then 2 hours) because I was deep cleaning the oven while making these. üôÑ I used a large wooden cutting board to form the rolls and my rectangle was about 12 x 18 inches, cut into 10 rolls. I used 2 x 9 inch diameter round silicone baking trays to make the rolls but next time I‚Äôll use my rectangle glass baking tray. The mocha icing recipe made just enough to frost 10 rolls. The dough turned out firm so maybe next time I won‚Äôt let the dough rise so very long. I think I‚Äôd also skip the coffee granules in the filling so the taste focuses more on the cinnamon. üòç

**2nd attempt:**  
I used margarine again, skipped vanilla extract, and used 230 grams of fed sourdough starter. I also added 1/2 tablespoon of ground caradmom to the dough ingredients.
