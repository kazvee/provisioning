# Quiche Pastry (using oil)
Makes: 1 quiche (can be doubled)

## Ingredients
1 cup (120 grams) flour  
1/4 cup cold water  
1/4 cup oil (I used olive oil)  
Pinch of salt

## Directions
Sift the flour and salt into a medium bowl. In a separate bowl or measuring jug, whisk the water and oil together and then pour it into the flour. Combine to make a ball of dough, roll and press into a pie dish. (Kneading doesn't seem necessary.)

## For the Filling
Fill the pastry with whatever you prefer (broccoli, cooked ham, onions, cheese, bacon bits, sliced tomato, etc.)  
Whisk 3 eggs into a measuring jug and then add any dairy product you prefer (milk, sour cream, plain yoghurt, a mixture of all these, etc.) until the entire thing reaches the 2 cup mark.

Pour the egg mixture over your fillings, and bake in an oven preheated to 180C/350F for 20 â€“ 30 minutes or so. I've read guidance that the internal temperature should be 74C/165F and 85C/185F. I usually stop mine at the lower end.

It's a good idea to blind bake the empty pie shell for 15 minutes beforehand, so the base doesn't get soggy. Not compulsory but it really does help!

## Other Tips I Found
Apparently this can be baked until just set (not overcooked), and then cooled and frozen for up to a month. When ready to serve, thaw it in the fridge overnight, and then bake it covered in foil, at 180C / 350F until heated through.

## My Notes
One batch of dough fits perfectly in my round silicone baking pan. I used frozen broccoli, mushrooms, onions, and grated strong cheddar. The frozen veg made the filling a bit watery so next time will need to microwave the veg a bit to get the water out. I didn't blind bake the pastry this time because I was hungry and didn't want to wait. ðŸ™‚

To reheat the leftovers, I preheated the oven to 180C/350F and warmed the slices for about 15 minutes.

The next couple of times I made this, I used my cast iron pan. It's larger than the silicone pan so I needed to double the dough recipe. The dough still shrunk a bit but I don't care. I  used some whole wheat flour, too. (I think it was about 80 grams whole wheat flour and 160 grams white all-purpose flour.)
