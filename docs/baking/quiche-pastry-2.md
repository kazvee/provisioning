# Quiche Pastry (using margarine)

## Ingredients
125 grams soft table margarine  
1 tablespoon water  
225 grams plain flour, sifted

## Directions
Using a pastry blender or a fork, mash the margarine together with the water and 2 tablespoons of flour to get a paste. Then, blend in the rest of the flour a little at a time until you have a smooth ball of dough.

Arrange it into a disc shape, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour. (Or you can freeze it at this point.) When well-chilled, roll out the dough and use as needed.

**Recommended:**  
Arrange in your baking tin, poke holes in the dough with a fork and blind bake in an oven preheated to 180C for 20 – 25 minutes first. Then add your filling and bake again as specified in your recipe.

## My Notes
One batch of this fits in my round silicone pans, so I’d need to double it to fit in my 30cm/12inch cast iron frying pan. I blind baked it for 25min, then added my quiche filling and baked again for 25 min.
