# Sourdough Drop Biscuits (using discard)

## Ingredients
1 1/4 cups (177 grams) all-purpose flour  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon sugar (Note: You can leave this out if you prefer a more savoury biscuit)  
3/4 teaspoon table salt  
1/2 cup milk  
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (226 grams) 100% hydration sourdough discard (cold)  
8 tablespoons (113.4 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly (about 5 minutes), plus 2 tablespoons (28.35 grams) melted butter for brushing biscuits

## Directions
In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt. In a medium sized bowl, whisk the milk and sourdough discard. Then, add in the 8 tablespoons (113.4 grams) of melted butter, and stir until the butter forms small clumps.  
Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture, stirring with a rubber spatula until it has all just combined, and the batter pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Take care not to overmix.

Using a greased 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop level amounts of batter and drop them onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or baking paper. Your biscuits should be about 2.25 inches diameter and 1.25 inches high, and spaced about 1.25 inches apart.  
Bake on the middle rack of an oven preheated to 475F / 245C (220C Fan) for 12 to 14 minutes, until the tops are golden brown and crisp.

When done baking, brush the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons (28.35 grams) of melted butter. Transfer to wire rack and let cool 5 minutes before serving. You can refresh day-old biscuits by heating them in a 300F / 150C (130C Fan) oven for 10 minutes.

## My Notes
These biscuits freeze well. We find them easy to reheat, either from room temperature or directly from frozen, in the microwave. The 2nd time I made these, I doubled the batch but left out the sugar, and we preferred them more savoury this way.
