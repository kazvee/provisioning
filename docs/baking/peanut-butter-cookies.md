# Easiest Peanut Butter Cookies Ever
*Yes, really only 3 ingredients!*

Servings: 1 to 2 dozen  
Preparation Time: 5 minutes  
Cooking Time: 15 minutes  
Total Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients
1 cup peanut butter  
1 cup sugar  
1 egg

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350F / 180C / Gas Mark 4. Mix all ingredients together. Make small balls, then dip a fork in flour and make criss crosses on balls. Bake for 10-12 minutes.

Can add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract if desired.

## My Notes
I'm not sure why the criss-crosses are necessary but I'm pretty sure it's illegal to make these cookies without them. ðŸ˜‰
