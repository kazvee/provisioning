# Marble Cake

## Ingredients
180 grams flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
3 eggs  
170 grams confectioner’s sugar  
2 tablespoons milk  
150 grams butter (melted)  
2 tablespoons cocoa powder  
75 grams grated bitter chocolate  
50 grams sliced almonds

## Directions
Beat eggs & sugar until foamy & double in volume. Slowly add flour, then butter and baking powder. Divide batter in two. Almonds go in one half, the grated chocolate and cocoa (made into a paste with the milk) go into the other.

Pour alternated layers of the two batters into buttered and floured tin loaf & swirl a knife through the batter to give it the marbled effect. Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4 and bake for 50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry.

## My Notes
I skipped the almonds and bitter chocolate gratings, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the whole mix, and added 1 Tablespoon of instant coffee granules mixed into 1 Tablespoon hot water to the ‘vanilla’ half of the batter. Took 50 min in my oven.
