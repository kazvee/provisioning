# Sourdough Chocolate Brownies

## Ingredients
230 grams semi-sweet chocolate chips (see **[Notes](#my-notes)** if you only have cocoa powder!)  
113 grams butter, melted  
100 grams sugar (don't reduce this, it's not overly sweet!)  
1 teaspoon (5 grams) vanilla extract  
2 eggs  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
200 grams sourdough starter (100% hydration)

## Directions
Using a microwave, melt the butter and chocolate chips for 2-3 minutes and stir well. Add in the sugar, vanilla extract, baking soda, and eggs. Whisk well to combine. Add in the sourdough stater and stir until it just comes together, make sure not to overmix! Add in any extras (nuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit, etc.) and pour into a greased 9-inch pan.  
Bake in an oven pre-heated to 180C / 350F for 25 to 30 minutes, checking (without opening the door!) after the first 20min. Make sure not to overbake these, you want a knife or toothpick to come out clean after baking.  
You can vary the sourdough starter amount: 160g will make it very chewy and dense, and 200g will make it more cake-like.

## My Notes
The above recipe only needed 1 of my round silicone baking trays so next time I'll double the recipe. I forgot to add the baking soda. üôÑ  

I didn't have chocolate chips in the house, so I used 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. I didn't have vanilla extract so I used 1 teaspoon banana extract. I sprinkled pearl sugar on the top which maybe next time I'd do before putting it in the oven?

I used 200g of my wholewheat sourdough discard and I think it could have still taken a bit more (maybe 25g more?) as the brownies were quite dense when done.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe, I thought it was meh but then I prefer a much more cake-ish brownie.  
I'd make these again because they use up my sourdough discard. I might double the recipe next time and make my half batch a bit cakier. üòè
