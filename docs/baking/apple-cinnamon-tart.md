# Apple & Cinnamon Tart
Serves: 6
*Can be frozen*

## Ingredients for the Pastry
225g (8oz) plain flour  
½ tsp salt  
100g (4oz) butter, chilled  
1 large egg, beaten

## Ingredients for the Filling
3 medium baking apples (Bramleys), thinly sliced  
75g (3oz) caster sugar  
Handful of sultanas / raisins  
Pinch of cinnamon

## Directions
Preheat the oven to 200C (Fan 180C) / Gas Mark 6.  
To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Using your fingertips, rub in the butter until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs, then add 2 tbsp beaten egg and just enough chilled water to make a soft, but not sticky, dough. Knead lightly for a few seconds until smooth, then chill for 10 minutes.

Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface into a circle to a diameter of about 38cm (15in). Transfer to a baking sheet – the pastry will overlap the sheet at this stage. Brush the surface of the pastry with beaten egg.

Place the sliced apples over the surface of the rolled-out pastry to within 7.5cm (3in) of the edge. Sprinkle the caster sugar on top and add a few sultanas and a pinch of ground cinnamon.

Gather the pastry around the filling, brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with a little more caster sugar. Bake for 25-30 minutes.
