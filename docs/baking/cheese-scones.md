# Cheese Scones
*Lovely and savoury, these are a bit of a change from the usual scone!*

## Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
1 teaspoon dry mustard  
pinch of salt  
1 cup whole-wheat flour  
3 teaspoons cold butter or margarine, cut in small pieces  
3/4 cup (3oz) finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese  
2/3 cup (about) milk

## Directions
Preheat oven to 425F (220C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet and set aside. Sift all-purpose flour, baking powder, dry mustard and salt into a large bowl. Stir in the whole-wheat flour.

With your fingers, rub in cold butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in 1/2 cup cheese. Make a well in center of mixture, add milk and mix with a fork to make a dough that BARELY holds together (you may need to press dough together with your hands).

Turn out onto floured surface and knead lightly. Roll out with a floured rolling pin or pat dough with your hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into rounds with a 2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter.

Place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Bake 8-10 minutes or until well risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. When cold, split and serve with butter. Makes about 12 scones.

## My Notes
These took 10 min in my oven. I didnâ€™t have whole wheat flour so just used 2 cups regular flour. I also doubled the butter and used about 1/2 cup more cheese.
