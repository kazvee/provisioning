# Sourdough Cheese Biscuits

## Ingredients
1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
3/4 teaspoon salt  
8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, cold  
1 cup (227g) sourdough starter discard

## Directions
In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt. Using a fork or pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture until it’s unevenly crumbly. Pour in the starter, mixing it all gently until just combined. (Note: If the dough seems very dry, you can drip in some milk or buttermilk, a little at a time, until it just holds together.)

Turn the dough out into a lightly-floured surface, and gently pat it into a 6-inch round that’s about 1-inch high. Using a biscuit cutter or a glass, cut the dough into round shapes (I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup to cut mine!) Try not to twist the cutting tool as you do this, since it could impact the way the biscuits rise in the oven.
Gently push the dough together as you cut biscuits out of it, until all the dough is used up.

Place the biscuits about 2 inches apart on a greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and bake for 20 – 23 minutes or until golden brown, using the upper third of an oven preheated to 220C / 425F.

## My Notes
I used parchment paper and the recipe made 8 biscuits for me. It took 20 minutes in my oven. The last time I made these, I grated the butter from frozen which worked really well. I forgot to move the oven rack but they turned out OK anyway.  
We really liked these, as they’re similar to an old family recipe. This recipe can be doubled and the biscuits can be frozen.
