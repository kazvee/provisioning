# Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients
2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour  
1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) baking soda  
1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) salt  
3/4 cup (170 grams) unsalted butter, melted  
1 cup (220 grams) packed brown sugar  
1/2 cup (100 grams) white sugar  
1 tablespoon (15 grams) vanilla extract  
2 eggs, beaten  
2 cups (335 grams) semisweet chocolate chips

## Directions
In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking soda and salt, and set aside.  
In a large bowl, use a hand blender to cream the butter, brown and white sugars. Add the eggs and vanilla extract. Add in the dry ingredients and use a wooden spoon to mix until just blended. Add the chocolate chips and stir again.  
Cover and set in the fridge to chill for an hour or two.  
Once dough has chilled, drop onto a cookie sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 165C / 325F for 15 ‚Äì 17 minutes.

## My Notes
This is our favourite recipe. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

**Winning batch:** I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and just under 1/2 cup white sugar, took 12 min in my oven. Best version yet! üòÄ

I‚Äôve also used half chocolate chips and half Zante currants that have been soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drained, for a bit of variety.
