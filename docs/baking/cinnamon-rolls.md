# Cinnamon Rolls

## Ingredients
4 cups (480 grams) flour  
1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons / 8 grams) quick yeast  
1 cup milk  
1/3 cup butter  
1/3 cup caster sugar  
1 large egg  
2 – 4 tablespoons softened butter  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
3/4 cup brown sugar  
3 teaspoons cinnamon  
1/2 cup chopped nuts

## Directions
In a saucepan heat milk, butter, sugar and salt till butter is just melted. While that is warming, sift together the flour and yeast. Add the milk and melted butter mixture to the flour along with the egg, beating with a mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the bowl. Beat a further 3 minutes on high speed. Then stir as much of the remaining flour as you can.

Turn the dough out on a floured surface and and knead in any flour left over. The dough should be soft but not wet, smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball and put in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Let rise in a warm place till double in size, about an hour.

Punch dough down and turn onto a floured surface. Cover and rest a further 10 minutes. Grease a 13×9×2 inch baking pan. Roll dough into a 18×10 inch rectangle and spread with the softened butter. Combine the cinnamon and brown sugar and sprinkle evenly on the butter, then sprinkle on the nuts. Roll up tightly, starting with the long side, and pinch to seal.

Cut the dough into 12 slices and arrange cut side down on the baking pan. Cover and let rest until about double, around 30-40 mins.

Brush rolls with a little single cream. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F / Gas Mark 4 for about 25 – 30 minutes. Check after 20 minutes if using a fan oven.

## Icing
8 tablespoons margarine, softened  
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar  
1/4 cup (2 oz) cream cheese  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1/8 teaspoon salt

## My Notes for the Icing
I used butter instead of margarine, and halved the recipe so I wouldn’t have TOO much icing! (It still makes PLENTY.)

## My Notes for the Cinnamon Rolls
Last time I made these, I didn’t make icing but used Pearl Sugar on top instead. I left out the nuts, and didn’t brush the tops with single cream.

It made 8 x rolls in my glass roasting dish (H 5cm x W 32cm x D 20cm) and took 20 min in the oven.
