# Double Chocolate Chip Muffins

## Ingredients
2 eggs  
1/2 cup (125 ml) oil  
1 cup (240 ml) milk  
1 teaspoon vanilla  
1 3/4 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour  
1/2 cup (85 g) sugar  
1/4 cup (35 g) cocoa powder  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/2 cup (85 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions
Preheat oven to 200C / 400F / Gas Mark 6 and prepare muffin pan. In large bowl add eggs, oil, milk and vanilla and combine well. In smaller bowl combine well flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, salt and chocolate chips. Combine wet and dry mixtures and fold together gently until just mixed. Spoon into muffin tin. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on rack.  
Hint: Sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top of each muffin before baking.

## My Notes
These turned out well! Held together nicely, and not overly sweet! Worth making again!
