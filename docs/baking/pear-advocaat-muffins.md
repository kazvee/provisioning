# Pear & Advocaat Muffins

## Ingredients
2 1/2 cups self-rising flour (225 g)  
1 cup sugar (200 g)  
1 tsp salt  
6 tbsp Advocaat  
1/2 cup milk (100 ml)  
1/2 cup oil (100 ml)  
1 pear, peeled and diced

## Directions
Preheat the oven to 347 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12 cup muffin tray with baking cups. Mix the self-rising flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl.

In another bowl, beat together the Advocaat, milk, and oil. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the diced pear, and stir until just combined. Spoon the mixture into the baking cups.Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown on top. (You can also use 2 eggs instead of the Advocaat.)

## My Notes
Canned pears work fine, too. This is also nice with chocolate chips.
