# Banana Bread 

## Ingredients
1 3/4 cups flour  
2/3 cup sugar  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1 cup bananas, mashed (about 3 bananas)  
1/3 cup shortening, butter or margarine  
2 tablespoons milk  
2 eggs  
1/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)

## Directions
Preheat oven to 180C / 350F. Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add bananas, margarine and milk. Beat with electric mixer on low until blended, then on high for 2 minutes. Add eggs and remaining flour and beat till blended. Pour into greased 8 x 4 x 2-inch loaf pan. Bake for 55 â€“ 60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean.
Cool 10 minutes in pan, then remove from pan and cool thoroughly. Store in an air-tight container.

## My Notes
Last time I made this I added 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the batter. I didn't use an elecric mixer, just a metal whisk. I used 1 cup of premashed frozen banana that I thawed slowly in the microwave. This recipe makes 1 loaf, but it can be doubled. The single load took 60 min in my oven (on non-convection). I baked it with the red silicone loaf tin inside a metal one, which is why it looks a little squished on the side.
