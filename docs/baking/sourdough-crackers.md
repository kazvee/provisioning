# Sourdough Crackers
*Made with discarded starter, right out of the fridge!*

## Ingredients
113 grams (1 cup) flour (wholewheat or all-purpose)  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
227 grams (1 cup) sourdough starter discard (unfed)  
57 grams (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature (could use use margarine instead)  
2 tablespoons dried herbs & spices (optional: try rosemary, dill, garlic, etc.)  
oil, for brushing  
coarse salt (such as kosher or sea salt) for sprinkling on top

## Directions
Combine the flour, salt, sourdough starter discard, butter, and herbs (if using) and mix until you get a smooth dough that is not sticky. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a small rectangular shape. Cover with clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or up to a couple of hours) until the dough is firm.

When ready to roll out your dough, prepare a piece of parchment/baking paper that will fit onto a baking sheet, and dust it lightly with flour. Lightly flour your rolling pin, and the top of the dough. Roll it out flat until it's about 1.5mm (1 1/16 inches) thick. The dough won't stay perfectly rectangular, but that's fine. The most important thing is that it's all the same thickness and as thin as you can get it.

Carefully slide the parchment paper with the dough on top of it onto your baking sheet. Brush it lightly with oil and sprinkle salt on the top.  
Using a pizza cutter or other utensil that won't tear the baking parchment or scratch your baking sheet, slice the dough into 3 centimetre (1.25 inch) squares. Use a fork to pierce little holes all over the top of the dough, to stop them puffing up too much as they bake.  
Bake in an oven preheated to 180C/350F for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden. (Make sure to reverse your cookie sheets back to front as well as transfer them from the top/bottom racks of the oven to ensure the crackers bake evenly.)  
Once fully browned, remove from oven and put the crackers on a cooling rack. Store in an airtight container for probably up to a week. Apparently these can be frozen as well.

## My Notes
I split the batch into half using wholewheat flour with 1 tablespoon Za'atar and for the other half I used all purpose (480) flour with 1 tablespoon dill. Not sure which flavour we prefer.  
As you can see I also only forked half to see how important that was. The non-forked half didn't puff up too much more.  
Definitely making these again!

## My Notes from 2nd Batch
This doubles well, and it's an easy enough ratio depending on how much discard you have as it's about twice as much discard as flour.  
I used an entire week's worth of discard: 508 grams of sourdough discard (100% hydration, 50/50 white/rye flour mix) and 254 grams of flour and it made 4 x baking tray's worth. I've been using a dough scraper to cut into squares but I should buy a pizza wheel to make it easier.

## My Notes from latest batch
I used margarine instead of butter, and tried about 1 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 tablespoon total of dill & mixed herbs. This took 40 minutes in my oven, using the non-convection Bake setting.

These are great with "Everything Bagel" seasoning, too! üòç
