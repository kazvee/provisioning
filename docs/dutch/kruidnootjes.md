# Kruidnootjes – Sinterklaas Gingerbread Cookies

## Ingredients
6.5 ounces flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
3 ounces demerera sugar, or raw suger  
0.5 ounces speculaasherbs **(See Note!)**
pinch of salt  
4.4 ounces cold butter, unsalted

**I'm guessing you don’t have any speculaasherbs, so you can mix it yourself using this:**  
0.5 ounces ground cinnamon  
0.07 ounces ground cloves  
0.07 ounces ground nutmeg  
0.035 ounces ground white pepper  
0.035 ounces gingerpoweder  
0.017 ounces ground cardamom

**TAKE CARE:** This is too much for your recipe of the Kruidnootjes. Use 0.5 ounces of this mix!

## Directions
Sieve the flour above a bowl. Add baking powder, herbs and salt. Add the butter to it in small lumps, and knead everything untill it’s a consistent mass. Leave it alone for half an hour.

Pre-heat the oven (150 C/310 F). Grease the baking plate, and roll little balls from the dough. Remember, the Kruidnootjes will get twice as big after baking them!

Bake them for about 20 minutes. No longer, they tend to get to hard quickly. Let them rest for a while (if you can stand the wait)! Store them in a cookie jar to keep them crispy!
