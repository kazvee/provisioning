# Welcome

Welcome to **Provisioning** — an online recipe collection. 

I keep my collected recipes here, for my own convenience and for easy sharing with my friends & family. 🍛🥘

Some are good. Some are better. Some I haven’t even tried yet. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  

The recipes tagged [In My Kitchen](tags/in-my-kitchen) are ones I’ve made and I add notes that I may or may not follow the next time I make the meal.

I try to remember to snap a quick photo of how a recipe turned out. 📷

## How to Use this Site

Feel free to browse the recipe categories using the left side menu, or [browse by tag](/docs/tags) using the top navigation bar. 📚

The [Blog](/blog/) section will be developed into a series of tasting notes about interesting & unusual food and/or drinks we've tried. 🧃
