# Kartoffelgratin – Potatoes au Gratin
Serves: 6 as a side dish

## Ingredients
2 lbs potatoes  
2 cups heavy cream  
1 – 2 c. (4-8 oz.) grated cheese such as Emmentaler or Gruyere  
1/2 cup leeks, chopped  
1 pinch ground nutmeg  
1 dash salt  
1 dash pepper

## Directions
Grease a 1 – 1 1/2 inch deep baking dish with butter or vegetable oil. Peel the potatoes and cut into very thin slices, about 2 – 3 mm thick. Place potato slices and chopped leek into the baking dish. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then pour the cream over everything.

Using the lowest possible oven rack, place the dish in an oven preheated to 350F / 180C / Gas Mark 4 for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown, the cream has thickened and the potatoes are tender.
