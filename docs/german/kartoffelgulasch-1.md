# Kartoffelgulasch – Potato Goulash
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
3 lbs potatoes, cubed  
2 lb onions, chopped  
1/2 cup oil  
1/2 cup paprika  
2 quarts cold water  
1 teaspoon marjoram  
1 teaspoon pepper  
1 garlic clove, finely chopped  
1 teaspoon caraway seeds

## Directions
Fry the onions in the oil on medium heat for 20 minutes or until golden. Remove from heat, and add paprika. (Do not fry the paprika, as it will make it bitter!) Add water and seasonings, and bring to the boil.

Add potatoes and simmer on medium heat until cooked. Adjust seasonings to taste. Thicken sauce with cornstarch if desired.

Serve with green salad, cucumber salad or cabbage salad, and boiled potatoes or spätzle.
