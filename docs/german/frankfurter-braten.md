# Frankfurter Braten – Roast Beef with Frankfurters

## Ingredients
4 lbs beef (chuck or brisket)  
3 Frankfurters (sausages)  
2 carrots, chopped into 1 inch pieces  
1 celery root, chopped into 1 inch pieces  
1 parsley root (also known as Hamburg or turnip-root parsley), chopped into 1 inch pieces  
2 onions, chopped into 1 inch pieces  
1 tablespoon mustard  
1 tablespoon tomato paste (also called tomato purée in the UK)  
2 cups red wine  
5 cups beef broth (or vegetable broth, or water)  
vegetable oil  
2 bay leaves  
4 juniper berries  
mustard powder  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
Make a hole in the beef roast, and insert the Frankfurters. Rub the roast with mustard, and season with salt and pepper.

In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil and sear the roast on all sied until nicely browned. Remove meat and set aside. Place root vegetable into the pot, and fry on medium heat for a few minutes. Add tomato purée, stir and fry for a minute or two more. Add wine to deglaze the pan, and reduce slightly. Add 4 (of your 5) cups of beef broth.

Return the roast to the pot, add the bay leaves and juniper berries, cover and simmer on medium heat until the meat cooked and tender.

Remove roast, set aside and keep warm. Discard the bay leaves and juniper berries, and purée the gravy in a blender or food processor. Thin the gravy with the remaining broth, (or water, milk, or cream) if necessary. Season to taste.

To serve, slice the meat and serve covered in gravy. This meal goes well with roast potatoes.
