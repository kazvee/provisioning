# Linsensuppe mit Würstchen - Slow Cooker Lentil Stew with Sausage

## Ingredients
500 grams dried brown lentils  
2 litres chicken stock or broth  
2 large onions, diced  
1 tablespoon oil/butter, to fry the onions  
500 grams grated carrots (or less, depending on your preference)  
250 grams celery, chopped into small pieces (or more, depending on your preference)  
2 tablespoons minced garlic  
1 teaspoon Maggi seasoning (or Worcestershire sauce)  
1 bay leaf  
2 tablespoon dried parsley  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/2 teaspoon celery salt  
1/2 teaspoon caraway seed  
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
500 grams cubed sausage, ham, speck, etc. (cooked or smoked)  
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, for serving (optional)

## Directions
In a large pan, heat the oil over medium flame and fry the sausage until done. Remove from pan and set aside. Add the onions to the pan and fry until golden brown. Remove from pan and set aside.  
Rinse the lentils, picking them over to remove any debris or stones, and drain. Place them in the slow cooker, and pour in the chicken stock. Add the carrots, minced garlic, Maggi seasoning, bay leaf, parsley, garlic powder, celery salt, caraway seed, nutmeg, and pepper. Stir in the sausage and onions. Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or until lentils are tender.  
If possible, stir the stew halfway through the cooking time, and check an hour before you plan to eat, to make sure lentils are tender.  
Remove bay leaf before serving, and stir in the apple cider vinegar, if desired.

## My Notes 

I used <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.aytacfood.co.uk/aytac-parmak-sucuk-finger-500g-x-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sucuk</a> with the casings removed, sliced into thick rounds, and fried until browned. We added the apple cider vinegar as a dash over the bowls of stew. It only took 8 hours in my slowcooker.  
The 2 litres of stock will make a thick stew, you can add more broth if you prefer a thinner soup.  
The top and sides will darken in colour, you will notice this when you stir halfway through, it doesn’t affect the taste.  
This freezes well.
