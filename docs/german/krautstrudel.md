# Krautstrudel – German Cabbage Strudel
Serves: 4 as a main dish or 8 as a side dish

## Ingredients for the dough
2 cups wheat flour, all purpose  
1 whole egg  
1/4 cup oil  
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  
1 cup lukewarm water (**Note:** Only prepare 1 cup water, do not use all of it first, but only if needed.)  
Salt  
Flour to work with  

## Ingredients for the filling
1 head green cabbage  
1 large onion, finely chopped  
1 or 2 carrots, peeled and grated  
2 eggs, whisked  
1 cup breadcrumbs  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 tablespoons butter  
1 tablespoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon pepper

## Directions for the dough
Mix flour, egg, oil, vinegar, water and salt, and knead for at least 5 minutes until the dough is smooth, and not too soft. Place the dough on an oiled plate and coat with a little oil. Cover with foil or a plate and put in a warm place (100F / 38C) to rest for at least 30 minutes.

## Directions for the filling
Remove the stalk and outer leaves from the head of cabbage, and chop it into thin strips. In a pot, heat the oil and sauté the onions and carrots for a few minutes. Add the chopped cabbage, stirring well, and sauté for another few minutes. Season with salt and pepper, add a cup of water, and cook, covered, for 5 – 7 minutes (depending on the thickness of the cabbage), until soft. When cooked, remove from heat, and set aside. Add in the whisked eggs and breadcrumbs, and stir well to bind the filling.

Placing the lukewarm dough ball on a clean, floured tea towel, roll and stretch it into a thin sheet. Spread the cooled filling onto the dough. Using the towel, roll the strudel, place on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Bake in an oven preheated to 350F / 180C / Gas Mark 4 for about 35 minutes.

You can either serve this as a main dish, dressed with a hot or cold herb sauce, or as a side, to accompany a pork roast or stew.
