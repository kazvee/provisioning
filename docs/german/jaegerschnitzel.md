# Jägerschnitzel – Hunter’s Schnitzel

## Ingredients
1 lb Pork cutlets, 1/2 inch thick  
1 egg, beaten  
Salt and pepper  
1/2 cup bread crumbs  
2 ounces bacon, diced  
4 ounces onion, chopped  
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced  
1 tablespoon tomato purée (or tomato paste)  
1/2 cup water  
1/2 cup dry wine  
1 dash thyme  
1/2 teaspoon paprika  
1 tablespoon parsley  
2 tablespoons sour cream  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
Pound the cutlets with a meat tenderizer, and rub with salt and pepper. Rest for about 10 minutes. Dip the cutlet in the egg, and then into the crumbs. Heat a small amount of oil on medium heat, then brown the cutlet for about 10 minutes on each side.

While meat is browning, fry the bacon and the onion until golden. Add tomato paste and mushrooms, and reduce heat. Add wine, water and seasonings, and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes before stirring in the sour cream. Return to heat for a few minutes, then serve.
