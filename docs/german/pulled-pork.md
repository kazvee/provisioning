# Zerzupftes Schweinefleisch - Slow Cooker Pulled Pork
Serves: 6 ‚Äì 8

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
2 kg (about 4.5 lbs) pork (shoulder/butt/etc.)  
1 onion, diced  
2 carrots, chopped  
1 teaspoon thyme (dried or fresh)  
1 teaspoon rosemary (dried or fresh)  
3 tablespoons sweet/hot mustard  
1 1/2 cup chicken/vegetable broth  
2 cups heavier sweet(ish) beer (perhaps a wheat beer or amber ale)  
salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions
Chop the onions and carrots, and place into the slow cooker. (Optional: Season the pork with salt and pepper to taste, then sear on all sides in a heavy pan on the stove). Place the pork in the slow cooker, and season with thyme and rosemary.  
Pour in your mustard, broth, and beer. Stir well and cover with the lid.  
Cook on High for 4 hours, or on Low for 8 hours.  
If desired, shred the meat with 2 forks and serve alongside potatoes and vegetables, or in a sandwich.

## My Notes
I didn‚Äôt sear the meat for this attempt, although it was against my better judgement at the time. The recipe turned out great but next time I will try searing the meat and frying the vegetables, so that I can compare the end results to see if the extra effort makes enough of a difference to justify the effort of frying meat and vegetables at 8 in the morning. üòâ  
We used Brutal Brewing‚Äôs Pistonhead Full Amber for this recipe.
