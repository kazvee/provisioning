# Semmelknödel – Bread Dumplings 2
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
1 lb white bread, dried and cut into 1/2 inch cubes  
1 large onion, very finely chopped  
4 eggs  
2 – 3 cups milk  
1/4 lb butter or margarine  
salt  
nutmeg  
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped  
2 tablespoons flour (optional, to bind dumpling)

## Directions
Melt the butter in a pan and lightly fry the onions. Add the milk and heat. Put the bread in a large bowl and pour the heated milk mixture over them, stirring just enough to moisten all the bread cubes. Be careful not to stir too much. Add eggs and stir a bit more. Season with salt, nutmeg and chopped parsley, then cover and let rest for about 20 minutes.

Using wet hands, grab a handful of dough and form it into tennis-ball shaped dumplings. Roll it into a smooth ball and set aside, repeating until all the dough is used. In a large pot, bring water to a rolling boil and add dumplings. Cover and bring to the boil again for 5 minutes, then reduce heat and simmer for a further 10 minutes.

Serve with goulash, or any other meat dish that has plenty of gravy to pour on top! Leftovers can be kept in the fridge overnight, then sliced and pan-fried in butter with a few eggs and a dash of salt and pepper.
