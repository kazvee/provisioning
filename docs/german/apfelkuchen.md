# Apfelkuchen – Apple Cake

## Ingredients
1 lb apples  
3 eggs  
2 cups flour, combined with 1 teaspoon baking powder  
1 cup sugar  
1 cup butter  
vanilla extract (to taste — about 1 teaspoon)  
cinnamon  
icing sugar  
salt

## Directions
Peel and core apples, and shop into large bite-sized pieces. Using a mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, and almost double in volume. Add salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.

Add one egg at a time, mixing well after each one, to create a light, foamy dough. Sift the flour and baking powder, and fold into the egg mixture, mixing well.

Pour about 1/3 of the dough into a pregreased cake pan. Add the apple pieces to the remining 2/3 of dough, mix well, and pour into the cake pan. Make sure the surface of the cake dough is flat and level, and bake in an oven preheated to 350F/180C/Gas Mark 4 for 50 – 60 minutes.

When done, remove from oven and leave in the cake tin to cool, sprinkling with icing sugar while still warm.

## My Notes
I've been told a 28 cm (11 inches approx) cake pan is ideal for this recipe.
