# Tafelspitz – Boiled Beef
Serves: 4 – 6

## Ingredients
3 lbs beef brisket  
(approx) 3 quarts cold water  
3 carrots, peeled  
1 large piece of celeriac, peeled  
2 leeks, cleaned  
1 root of hamburg parsley, peeled  
a few springs of lovage (Maggikraut)  
2 onions, halved  
Salt  
Peppercorn  
Juniper berry  
Bay leaves

## Directions
In a large pot, bring water to a rolling boil and add bay leaves, juniper berries, peppercorn and the meat. Simmer for about 90 minutes, skimming the surface every so often to remove any grey foam, so the broth remains clear.

Add the vegetables and boil until they are cooked and meat is tender.

Cut the meat against the grain, into slices about an inch in size. Serve covered with a bit of broth, with some of the chopped-up root vegetables. This meal goes well with sautéed potatoes, creamed spinach, apple-horseradish sauce and chives.
