# Kartoffelsalat â€“ Potato Salad
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
1 lb (about 4 medium) potatoes  
1/2 cup beef or chicken broth  
1 medium onion, chopped  
1 medium dill pickle, diced  
2 teaspoons mustard  
1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice  
1 tablespoon oil  
fresh parsley, chopped  
salt  
black pepper

## Directions
Wash potatoes and boil them (skins on) until tender. Peel while hot, cut into 1/4 inch slices, cover and keep warm.

In a medium saucepan, bring the broth to a gentle boil and add the onions, mustard, and vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for a few minutes and them pour over the still-warm potato slices. Mix gently. Add dill pickle, oil, parsley, and chives. Leave to rest at room temperature, covered, for about 30 minutes before serving. (If you can wait that long).

You can add up to 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise instead of the oil if you prefer. Optionally, add cooked, chopped bacon.

## My Notes
I prefer using chicken broth instead of beef. I never use the oil or mayo and have never added bacon, but I do think the dill pickles are an absolute must! In a pinch, you can also use the brine from a jar of garlic dill pickles instead of the vinegar or lemon juice.  
The last time I made this, I used small potatoes with thin peel, so just left it on. I usually add about a tablespoon of dried herbs (chives, dill, or parsley) if I donâ€™t have fresh ones.  
I tend to double this recipe, since any leftovers keep nicely in the fridge for a few days, and seems to taste better the next day. Iâ€™ve kept it for 2-3 days without issue but itâ€™s rare that it lasts that long. ðŸ™‚

For leftovers, just plate up however much you want and let it get to room temperature before eating. (I guess you could also microwave it?)
