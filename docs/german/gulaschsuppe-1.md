# Gulaschsuppe – Goulash Soup
Serves: 8

## Ingredients
1/2 lb stewing beef  
1 large onion  
2 tablespoons paprika  
6 cups cold water  
1/2 lb potatoes  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 teaspoon caraway seeds  
1 teaspoon marjoram  
salt and pepper

## Directions
Chop the onion, meat and potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes. Place the potatoes in a bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown. Fry the onions in the oil on moderate heat for 10 minutes until golden. Add the meat and fry until heated through.

Remove from heat, and add paprika. Then add water, mix well, and bring to the boil, seasoning as necessary. Simmer for about one hour. Add the cubed potatoes 20 minutes before the meat is cooked and tender.

The starch from the potatoes will thicken the soup somewhat, but you may want to thicken it more. Season to taste. Serve with: A bread roll, garlic bread, or any other type of bread.
