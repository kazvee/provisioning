# Grießnockerlsuppe – Semolina Dumpling Soup
Serves: 6 – 10  
Cooking time: About 1 hour

*When your [beef soup](./rindsuppe.md) is almost ready, start the dumplings. It will take about 45 minutes until they are ready to serve.*

## Ingredients
5 ounces butter  
5 ounces semolina  
2 eggs  
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley  
salt  
nutmeg

## Directions
Leave butter to sit at room temperature until soft (or heat carefully in the microwave), and add the eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition until mixture almost doubles in volume. Add semolina and mix thoroughly. Season with salt, nutmeg and parsley.
Once the semolina has soaked up the egg and butter mixture, cover and leave to stand in the fridge for 20 minutes. In the meantime, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and add salt if desired.

To form the dumplings, wet your hands with warm water nd use a wet tablespoon to scoop up some of the dough onto the palm of one hand. Roll the dumpling to form it into a smooth oblong shape (like a mini-football). Set aside onto a non-stick surface, and repeat until all the dough has been used up.

Using a slotted spoon, gently immerse all dumplings, return to boil for 2 minutes, then turn off the heat. Cover the pot and let stand for 15 minutes. The dumplings should double in size, and are now ready to serve.

Place 1 – 2 dumplings in a bowl filled with beef broth, some vegetables and garnish with freshly chopped chives.
