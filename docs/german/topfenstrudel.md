# Topfenstrudel – Quark (Cream Cheese) Strudel
Serves: 8

## Ingredients for the Dough
2 cups wheat flour, all purpose  
1 egg  
1/4 cup oil  
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  
1 cup lukewarm water (Prepare 1 cup water but do not use all of it first, only use what's needed.)  
Salt  
Flour to work with

## Directions for the Dough
Mix flour, egg, oil, vinegar, water and salt, and knead for at least 5 minutes until the dough is smooth, and not too soft. Place the dough on an oiled plate and coat with a little oil. Cover with foil or a plate and put in a warm place (100F / 38C) to rest for at least 30 minutes.

## Ingredients for the Filling
1 1/2 lbs quark  
1/2 lb butter  
2 eggs  
1 cup raisins  
1 1/2 cups sugar  
zest of 1/2 a lemon  
dash vanilla sugar or aroma/extract  
pinch of salt

## Directions for the Filling
Mix butter and half of the sugar for 3 minutes or until butter volume starts to increase. Add the eggs and the rest of the sugar, and mix for another 3 minutes. Add Quark to the mixture and stir to combine. Add raisins, a pinch of salt, the lemon zest and the vanilla flavouring, and stir well.

Using a clean tea towel, roll out the strudel dough and make sure it is very thin. Stretch the dough with the floured backs of your hands. Spread the filling onto the dough. Use the tea towel to roll and lift the strudel into your baking tin.

Bake at about 350F / 180C / Gas Mark 4 for about 45 minutes. Sprinkle with icing sugar, and serve lukewarm with a warm vanilla sauce.
