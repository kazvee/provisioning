# Rote Beete Salat â€“ Beetroot Salad

## Ingredients
5 large beetroot, cooked and sliced  
1 medium white onion, sliced into rings  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar  
1 cup water  
pinch of sugar  
pinch of caraway powder  
salt to taste

## Directions
Remove leaves and stems from beetroot, wash and steam for 20-30 minutes, until cooked and tender throughout. Run cold water over them to make peeling easier. Slice them into thin rounds, about 1/8 inch thick.

Peel and slice the onion, separate into rings. Mix onion and beetroot slices.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the vinegar, oil, and water. Stir in the sugar, caraway, and salt to taste. Pour this mixture over the still warm beetroot slices. Let it stand for several hours to allow the beetroot to absorb all the flavours, before serving.

## My Notes
I make this using the precooked beetroot that we get from the shop as it's easier. I donâ€™t usually add the water at all, and I use caraway seeds instead of powder. Turns out great. ðŸ™‚
