# Kalbsgulasch – Veal Goulash

## Ingredients
3 ounces vegetable oil  
2 lbs veal cubes  
1 lb onions, finely chopped  
1 tablespoon flour  
1/4 pint sour cream  
1 – 2 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika  
salt

## Directions
Fry onions in the oil until golden. Add veal, and fry until brown. Remove from heat, add paprika and salt and mix well. Add a little water, then return to low heat and let simmer for about an hour, until meat is tender.

Mix the sour cream and flour, and add it to the goulash. Add 1 tablespoon of tomato purée and an additional teaspoon of paprika if desired.

Serve with noodles, rice, or spätzle. 

*(I’m adding the umlaut-free spelling of spaetzle in here to make it easier to search for this recipe.)*
