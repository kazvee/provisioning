# Brotsuppe – Bread Soup
Serves: 2

## Ingredients
1 litre beef broth (you can also use vegetable broth)  
300 grams stale white bread (like you would use for bread dumplings)  
2 eggs  
3 tablespoons heavy cream  
salt  
pepper  
nutmeg  
chives or parsley, chopped (optional)

## Directions
In a medium pot, heat up the stock and add the white bread. As it heats up, the bread will absorb the stock and start to dissolve. Cover and bring to a boil. Using a whisk, mix well until combined. Adjust seasonings to taste.

In a bowl, mix cream and eggs, and slowly pour this mixture into the simmering soup, using a wooden spoon instead of the whisk so that the bits of egg aren’t too small.

Serve garnished with chopped parsley or chives.
