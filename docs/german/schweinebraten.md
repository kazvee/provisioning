# Schweinebraten – Roast Pork
Cooking time: 2 – 3 hours

## Ingredients
3 lbs pork shoulder or belly (or side ribs, rib roast, shoulder blade roast..)  
1 celery root  
(approx) 2 – 3 carrots  
(approx) 1 – 2 medium onions  
(approx) 2 – 3 medium potatoes  
10 (or more) garlic cloves, chopped  
salt, pepper, caraway seeds  
Water, beer or broth

## Directions
Rub meat with garlic, salt, pepper and caraway seeds. Heat oil in a large frying pan and sear the meat on all sides. Place into a large roasting pan, and cook in oven preheated to 350F/180C/Gas Mark 4 for an hour.

Chop vegetables into bite-size pieces and arrange around the meat. Add the water, beer or broth and return to oven for another 2 hours or so, until meat is cooked and tender. Remember to baste the meat occasionally so it doesn’t dry out.

Serve with dumplings, boiled potatoes, rice or noodles.
