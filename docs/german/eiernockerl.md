# Eiernockerl – Egg Dumplings
Serves: 2 – 3 as a main dish, or 4 – 6 as a side

## Ingredients for the Nockerl
2 cups (450 g) all-purpose flour  
3 eggs  
1 cup (240 ml) lukewarm water  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1/3 teaspoons nutmeg  
1/3 teaspoons pepper  
1/2 teaspoon salt

## Directions for the Nockerl
Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Sift flour into a large bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg. Separately whisk the eggs and add eggs with water and oil to the flour. Combine well by stiring as little as possible just so the dough is smooth, thick and well mixed, using your hands if preferred!

The dough should very soft, but not runny. If you took a spoonful of dough and turned it upside down, the dough should only very slowly fall off the spoon. If you think the dough is too soft, just use some more flour. On the other hand if you think it too hard, use some more water.

Drop spoonfuls of dough into the boiling water, letting them simmer until they float to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon, and set aside to cool, repeating the entire process until all the dough has been used.

## Ingredients for the Eiernockerl
3 eggs, lightly beaten  
2 tablespoons butter  
the nockerl dumplings you just made

## Directions for the Eiernockerl
Heat the butter in a large frying pan, add the nockerl and the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally. When the eggs are cooked, garnish with sweet paprika powder, and serve alongside a salad.
