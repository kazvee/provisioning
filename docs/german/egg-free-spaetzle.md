# Egg-free SpÃ¤tzle

## Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour  
1 cup chickpea/gram flour (or soy or durum flour)  
1/2 teaspoon sea salt  
1/4 teaspoon turmeric  
1 cup milk (or non-dairy alternative)  
1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)

## Directions
Sift the all-purpose flour, chickpea flour, sea salt, and turmeric together in a medium bowl.  
Pour the milk into a separate larger bowl.  
Slowly add the dry ingredients into the milk, whisking as you go along to get a smooth batter. The consistency should be a little thicker than pancake batter but not as thick as bread dough. Adjust as needing with more flour or milk.  
Mix the batter until it starts to get gluey, developing the gluten.  
Cover, and let rest for 30 minutes.

In the meantime, get a large pot of water boiling on the stove. (Once boiling, you can add the olive oil to this, but I donâ€™t find it necessary.)  
Use your preferred method or spÃ¤tzlemaker to drop bits of dough into the water, allowing to boil for 2 â€“ 3 minutes or until they float to the top.  
Remove cooked noodles with a slotted spoon, placing them into a bowl filled with cold water to stop the cooking process, before draining completely.  
Repeat until all the batter has been cooked, cooled, and drained.  
Fry the noodles in an oiled pan, garnished with sea salt and margarine, or as you prefer.

## My Notes
I wasnâ€™t sure how well these would fluff up without eggs, but I had a craving and some gram flour in the house, soâ€¦ ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m glad I gave them a try! These made enough for 6 x side dishes to accompany goulash.
