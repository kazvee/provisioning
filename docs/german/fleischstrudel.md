# Fleischstrudel – German Meat Strudel
*Savory meat pastry*

## Ingredients for the dough
2 cups wheat flour, all purpose  
1 whole egg  
1/4 cup oil  
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  
1 cup lukewarm water*  
Salt  
Flour, to work with

## Ingredients for the filling
1 lb ground, cooked meat (leftover roast, boiled beef, etc.)  
1 large onion, finely chopped  
1 tablespoon chopped parsley or lovage  
1 tablespoon oil  
2 tablespoons butter, melted  
2 carrots (optional)  
salt  
pepper

## Directions for the dough
*Only prepare 1 cup water, do not use all of it first, but only if needed.  
Mix flour, egg, oil, vinegar, water and salt, and knead for at least 5 minutes until the dough is smooth, and not too soft. Place the dough on an oiled plate and coat with a little oil. Cover with foil or a plate and put in a warm place (100F / 38C) to rest for at least 30 minutes.

## Directions for the filling
Blend meat and carrots in a blender or food processor until they form a chunky paste, and place into a mixing bowl. In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the onion until golden. Add this to the carrot and meat minced mixture, and add the parsley, salt and pepper, mixing well.

Placing the lukewarm dough ball on a clean, floured tea towel, roll and stretch it into a thin sheet. Brush with melted butter, leaving a 3 inch border uncovered. Spread the filling over the dough. Using the towel, roll the strudel, place on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter.

Bake at 370F/188C/Gas Mark 5 for about an hour. Remove from oven, brush with milk, and bake for another 5 – 10 minutes. Serve with clear beef broth, or brown gravy and a side salad.
