# Apfelstrudel – Apple Strudel
Serves: 8 as a dessert, or 4 as a main dish

## Ingredients for the dough
2 cups wheat flour, all purpose  
1 whole egg  
1/4 cup oil  
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  
1 cup lukewarm water (**Note:** Only prepare 1 cup water, do not use all of it first, but only if needed.)
Salt  
Flour to work with

## Ingredients for the sweetcrumbs
1/2 cup breadcrumbs  
butter  
sugar  
cinnamon

## Ingredients for the filling
2 lbs apples  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/2 cup raisins  
1 lemon  
cinnamon  
rum (or rum flavouring)  
1/2 cup butter, melted  
1/2 cup milk  

## Directions for the sweetcrumbs
Melt butter in a pan, add breadcrumbs, sugar and ground cinnamon. Fry lightly and stir well until crumbs are hot, but not browned.

## Directions for the dough
Mix flour, egg, oil, vinegar, water and salt, and knead for at least 5 minutes until the dough is smooth, and not too soft. Place the dough on an oiled plate and coat with a little oil. Cover with foil or a plate and put in a warm place (100F / 38C) to rest for at least 30 minutes.

## Directions for the filling
Peel and slice the apples. Add raisins, sugar, lemon, cinnamon and rum. Mix and squeeze lightly so that the apples absorb the flavours.

Placing the lukewarm dough ball on a clean, floured tea towel, roll and stretch it into a thin sheet. Brush with melted butter, and spread the sweetcrumbs on top, leaving a 3 inch border uncovered. Spread the filling over the sweetcrumb base.

Using the towel, roll the strudel, place on a baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Bake at 370F/188C/Gas Mark 5 for about an hour. Remove from oven, brush with milk, and bake for another 5 – 10 minutes.

Sprinkle lightly with icing sugar, and serve warm.
