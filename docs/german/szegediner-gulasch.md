# Szegediner Gulasch – Goulash with Shredded Cabbage

## Ingredients
2 ounces vegetable oil  
1 lb pork shoulder, cut into cubes  
1/2 lb onions, finely chopped  
3 – 4 medium tomatoes, cut into strips  
3 – 4 medium green peppers, cut into strips  
1 lb shredded white cabbage  
1 – 2 teaspoons Hungarian paprika  
salt  
pepper  
caraway seeds

## Directions
Fry onions until golden, then add meat and fry lightly, taking care not to brown the cubes too much. Add the tomatoes and peppers, and stir well. Add the shredded cabbage and the seasonings. Simmer slowly for about an hour.

When meat and cabbage is tender, you can add 2 – 3 tablespoons of sour cream just before serving if desired.

Serve with boiled potatoes.
