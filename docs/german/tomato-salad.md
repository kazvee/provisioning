# Sweet & Sour Tomato Salad
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
7 tomatoes  
1 small yellow onion  
1/2 cup white sugar  
1/2 cup distilled white vinegar  
1/2 cup vegetable oil  
salt & pepper to taste

## Directions
Thinly slice the tomatoes. Cut the onion in half through root end, then thinly slice into half-circles. In a large bowl, toss together tomatoes, onion, sugar, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. You may adjust the amounts of vinegar and sugar according to your taste.  
Serve at room temperature.

## My Notes
Last time I made this, I used 2 Roma tomatoes, 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup vinegar, and salt and pepper.
