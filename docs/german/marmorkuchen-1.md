# Marmorkuchen - Marble Coffee Cake
*Here's my family's version of the recipe, using coffee instead of [cocoa](marmorkuchen-2.md).* ðŸ™‚

## Ingredients
150 g butter or margarine  
2 cups (400 g) sugar (could probably lower this to 300g)  
4 eggs  
3 cups milk  
4 cups (500 g) flour  
1 lemon zest  
2 â€“ 3 tablespoons coffee grinds  
**And ONE of the below options:**  
a. 2 teaspoons baking power and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
b. 3 teaspoons baking powder  
c. 1 package Dr Oetker baking powder (package size: 3 1/2 teaspoons / 17.5 ml) *I donâ€™t think these size sachets are sold in Canada anymore!*    

## Directions
Sift together the flour and whichever option from a/b/c you used above (for the baking soda/powder/Dr Oetker sachet) and set aside.  
Cream the butter, and gradually add the sugar, followed by the egg, milk, and lemon zest.  
Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and stir well to combine. Remove half the batter and set aside â€“ this will be the plain part of the cake!  
Add the coffee grinds to the other half of the cake batter.  
Pour the coffee flavoured mixture into the centre of a greased and floured bundt pan, and the white batter around it. Bake for 1 hour at 350F.

## My Notes
I use 2 loaf size tins for this recipe, and they took about 45 min in my fan-assisted oven at 180C. I'm told that it can also be made in a 27â€³ x 4.5â€³ x 2.5â€³ Pyrex cake pan.
