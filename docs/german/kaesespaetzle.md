# Käsespätzle – Noodle Dumplings With Cheese

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 tablespoon butter  
4 ounces cheese (Emmental or Gruyère)  
1/2 cup broth or stock (or water)  
1 medium onion, chopped or sliced  
salt  
pepper  
chives, freshly chopped

## Directions
In a large frying pan, heat the oil and butter and sauté the onion until slightly coloured. Add the spätzle and stir, making sure that the noodles are heated through.

Increase the heat to medium and add the grated cheese. Pour in the broth or stock — this liquid will cook off, we only use it to help the cheese melt and spread evenly throughout the mixture. Stir well, until the liquid has disappeared.

Adjust seasonings to taste, and serve.
