# Kartoffelsuppe – Potato Soup

## Ingredients
2 lbs potatoes  
1 small celery root  
1 small onion  
6 cups water or stock  
salt  
pepper  
sugar  
1 tablespoon oil  
1 bay leaf  
dash vinegar OR lemon juice OR lime juice

## Directions
Peel potatoes and celeriac and chop into 1 inch pieces. Peel and finely chop the onion. In a large pot, heat the oil and fry the onions until lightly browned. Add potatoes and celery root, stir well and cook until heated through.

Fill the put with water, and season with salt, pepper and sugar and bring to the boil. Cook until the potatoes are soft. Discard the bay leaf, and mix the soup (in batches) in a blender or food processor and return to the pot.

Season to taste, and add a dash of vinegar, lemon or lime juice.

The starch from the potatoes should be enough to thicken. If the soup is too thick, add water. To thicken the soup, add a finely grated a raw potato and cook for another few minutes.

Serve with: Brown bread croutons, lightly fried in butter or olive oil. Garnish with chopped parsley or chives.
