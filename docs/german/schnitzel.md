# Schnitzel â€“ Breaded Cutlets
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
4 thin cutlets of pork, veal, or chicken  
salt  
pepper  
flour  
breadcrumbs  
2 eggs, beaten  
oil  
1 lemon  
cranberry sauce or lingonberry jam

## Directions
Prepare 3 plates. Fill the 1st one with flour, the 2nd with the egg, and the 3rd with breadcrumbs. Use small amounts to begin with, as you can always add more of anything if needed.

Pound the meat cutlets with a meat tenderizer until quite thin. Season with pepper.

Coat the meat in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Fill a pan with about 1/2 inch of oil, and deep fry the cutlets until golden on both sides. Rest on a paper towel to remove excess oil. Salt if desired and serve.

Optionally, you can fry the schnitzel in a bit of butter after deep frying.

## My Notes
hen making this, the advice Iâ€™ve always been given is that 'the schnitzel needs to be swimming' in the oil, so make sure to use enough. (I usually don't because when frying other things, I try to use as little oil as possible!).

Also I don't usually bother with the seasoning, I just use flour, egg, and breadcrumbs and it tastes lovely as it is once the pork's all golden-brown. ðŸ™‚
