# Krautsalat – Cabbage Salad
Serves 8 – 10

## Ingredients
1 head (about 1.5 lbs) white (green) cabbage, finely shredded  
salt  
sugar  
caraway seeds (whole or ground)  
pepper  
white wine vinegar (or apple vinegar)  
vegetable oil or 1/2 cup chopped bacon, cooked until crunchy  
1 medium onion, fried until crunchy (optional)

## Directions
Add 1 tablespoon salt to the shredded cabbage, mix well, and let stand for 15 minutes.

Squeeze the cabbage, and mix again. (This helps the cabbage to let water, and makes it more tender.)

Season to taste with caraway seeds, a spoonful of sugar, vinegar, and oil. Mix well and let stand for 30 minutes to allow flavours to combine. Serve lukewarm.
