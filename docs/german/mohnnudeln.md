# Mohnnudeln – Poppy Seed Noodles
Serves: 3 – 4 as dessert, or 2 as a main course

## Ingredients
1 lb potatoes, mealy high starch  
2 eggs  
10 ounces wheat flour  
salt  
flour, to work with  
3 ounces poppy seeds, ground  
4 ounces unsalted butter  
icing sugar

## Directions
Boil the potatoes until done, then peel and mash them while they are still hot. Set aside to cool. Add eggs, flour and mix quickly, taking care not to overmix. Ingredients should be well-combined but not kneaded. Cover with flour and let rest for 20 minutes.  
Separate the dough into small pieces. Lightly flour your hands, and knead the bits of dough into small finger-sized pieces. Set noodles aside on a floured surface until all the dough is used up.

Bring a large pot of water to the boil and add all the noodles at once. Do not stir. Allow the water to return to the boil, and move the pot around gently to get the noodles off the bottom of the pot. Once boiling, remove from heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes before draining.

Add butter to the now-empty pot, add noodles and fry lightly to give them a bit of colour. (If serving as a side dish, it’s usually best to give them more colour.)

Add ground poppy seeds and sugar, stir gently and serve right away.
