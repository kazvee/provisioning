# Apfelkren – Apple & Horseradish Sauce
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
1 lb apples  
1 lemon  
2 cups water  
2 tablespoons horseradish, freshly grated  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon pepper

## Directions
Peel & core the apples, and chop into bite-sized pieces. In a large pot, bring water to a boil, and add the apple pieces. Simmer until soft.

Strain apple pieces, and mash until you get a nice smooth apple sauce. Add lemon juice and stir well. Store, covered, in the fridge until chilled.

Remove from fridge and add ther sugar, horseradish, salt and pepper, mixing well. You can serve this immediately, or make it a day in advance and store it in a sealed container in the fridge. This goes particularly well with [boiled beef](./tafelspitz.md).
