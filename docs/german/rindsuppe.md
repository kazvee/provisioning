# Rindsuppe – Beef Broth
Serves: 6 - 8  
Cooking time: 2 - 3 hours

## Ingredients
1 1/2 lbs beef bones  
1 piece of beef chuck  
carrots  
celery root  
leeks  
parsley root  
garlic  
2 onions, whole & unskinned  
peppercorns  
juniper berry  
bay leaf  
salt

## Directions
Place the bones in a pot of boiling water for 1-2 minutes to blanch, then drain and rinse with cold water. Place bones in soup pot, fill with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce heat, add beef, and leave to simmer gently for about an hour. (Note: Do not boil, as this will cause the clear broth to turn muddy. Also make sure to skim the surface regularly to remove any grey scum that accumulates.)

Cut the onions in half and sear the cut surface until blackened. Add the onions, root vegetables and all herbs except salt. The broth will turn a lovely golden colour from the onion skins. Simmer until the meat is tender, and the vegetables are cooked. By now the broth should have a strong taste. Season with salt and more ground pepper if desired.

Serve with some of the chopped up vegetables and meat, garnished with freshly chopped chives or another chopped herb. You can add soup noodles, pancake strips, small potato dumplings, or small [semolina dumplings](./griessnockerlsuppe.md) if desired.
