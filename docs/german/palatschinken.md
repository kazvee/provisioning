# Palatschinken â€“ Pancakes
Makes: about 15 thin pancakes

## Ingredients
2 cups milk  
3 eggs  
8 ounces flour  
2 teaspoons oil  
salt  
butter  
apricot jam  
icing sugar

## Directions
Combine milk, eggs, and a little salt. Add flour and oil and mix thoroughly until liquids are absorbed. Let the mixture stand for at least 10 minutes.

Coat the surface of a large frying pan in oil, and heat until it starts to smoke lightly. (Be careful not to burn the oil!) Add butter, and once it melts, pour some batter into the pan. Cook until golden on both sides, flipping once.

Place the hot pancake on a plate, fill with jam and roll. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.

## Tips
You can also let the pancakes cool, and then stuff with various fillings, or use them instead of lasagna noodles! To serve the pancakes in a beef broth or other clear soup, omit the sugar in the recipe and slice into thin strips.

## My Notes
I must have poured too much batter into the pan because this only made 6 pancakes! ðŸ˜® They were VERY filling for just 2 people, so next time Iâ€™m going to see if I can reduce the recipe by 1/3. We filled some of them with sultanas/raisins and maple syrup, and some of them with lingonberry jam. Really yummy!
