# Rindsgulasch â€“ Beef Goulash 2

## Ingredients
3 ounces vegetable oil  
2 lbs beef cubes (shoulder or chuck)  
2 lbs finely chopped onions (Rule: same amount of onions to meat! ðŸ˜‰)  
1 pint beef broth or water  
2 tablespoons tomato purÃ©e  
1 tablespoon hot Hungarian paprika  
2 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika  
zest of 1/2 a lemon  
1 tablespoon wine or apple cider vinegar  
1 teaspoon ground caraway  
1 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic  
1/2 teaspoon thyme  
1 teaspoon marjoram  
2 bay leaves  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
In a medium pot, heat the oil and fry the beef cubes until browned. Add the onions and cook until transparent. Add the vinegar, paprika, tomato purÃ©e, remaining spices, and stir well. Add the beef broth (or water), stir again and bring to the boil.

Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 60 to 90 minutes or until beef is tender. Add a little water from time to time if the goulash is getting too thick.

Serve with bread dumplings or plain boiled potatoes.
