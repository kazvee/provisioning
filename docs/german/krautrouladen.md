# Gefüllte Krautrouladen – Stuffed Cabbage Rolls
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
1 head white cabbage  
1 lb ground pork, beef, or lamb  
2 whole eggs  
1 cup sour cream  
1 cup rice  
2 onions  
3 – 4 cloves garlic  
2 tablespoons flour  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
3 tablespoons paprika  
Parsley  
Salt  
Pepper  
Caraway seeds

## Directions
Peel onions and garlic and chop finely. Discard the outer leaves of the cabbage head. Select 8 large sturdy leaves and boil them in salted water. Reserve this water for later use. Quarter the rest of the cabbage head, remove stalk and chop cabbage into one-inch pieces.

Boil the rice for about 5 minutes or until tender, and drain. Combine the meat, rice, eggs, half the onions and half the garlic. Season with 1 tablespoon paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread the cooked cabbage leaves out on a flat surface, fill with meat and roll up. There is no need to fasten them closed.

Lightly sauté the remaining onions and garlic in oil and add the chopped cabbage, stirring until heated through. Add the remaining paprika and stir. Take care to not fry the paprika as it will make it bitter.

Add 3 cups of the reserved cabbage water (or vegetable broth). Season with caraway seeds, salt and pepper. Add the cabbage rolls, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.

Remove the cooked cabbage rolls, and keep them warm. Mix half of the sour cream with flour, add to the cabbage stew, and stir as it thickens.

Serve with: Boiled potatoes. Garnish with the rest of the sour cream, and freshly chopped parsley.
