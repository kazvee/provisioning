# Reisfleisch – Pork Goulash With Rice
Serves: 4 as a main dish

## Ingredients
1 lb pork, cut into 1/2 inch cubes (you can also use chicken, beef or lamb)  
2 onions, chopped  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
3 teaspoons paprika  
3 cups water or stock  
1 1/2 cups uncooked rice  
1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon pepper  
dash of sugar  
1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen)

## Directions
In a large pot, heat the oil and fry the onions until lighly browned. Remove from heat, add paprika powder and stir. Pour in the water or stock, bring to the boil and cook for 1/2 an hour.

Add the seasonings and meat and let boil for another 30 minutes. When the meat is cooked, add the uncooked rice, and bring to the boil again. Add the peas, (or small carrot cubes, or whatever vegetables you like best!). Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let it sit for 15 minutes, stirring from time to time.

Afterwards, the rice should be cooked and most of the liquid should have been absorbed, giving this dish the consistency of a risotto. Serve with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese on top. This dish goes well with a green salad or a cucumber salad.
