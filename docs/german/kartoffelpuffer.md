# Kartoffelpuffer - Potato Pancakes

## Ingredients
750 grams russet potatoes  
2 medium onions  
3 eggs  
200 grams (approx.) flour  
salt, to taste  
nutmeg, to taste (Despite my burning hatred of nutmeg, I do have it in my spice cabinet and I did use a few dashes of it in this recipe.)  
vegetable oil, for frying

## Directions
Peel the potatoes and onions, and use a box grater to grate them into a medium-sized bowl. Transfer them to a strainer placed inside a bowl to catch the liquid. Press down on the grated potato to remove as much water as possible. Transfer the drained potato to another bowl. Carefully pour off the water from the collected potato liquid so you only keep the milky starch at the bottom. Pour the starch over the drained potatoes, and add the flour and eggs. Season to taste and mix well to combine.

In a large pan over medium heat, heat the oil up and pour enough batter into the pan to form a pancake. Fry, flipping once, until cooked through and golden (about 8 minutes).

When cooked, transfer pancakes to a paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Continue to cook the rest of the batter in batches, adding more oil to the pan as needed. Serve with applesauce or your preferred condiment on the side.

## My Notes
Sometimes I skip the onions, it depends if I have them in the house. I havent yet tried a food processor to do the grating, but I plan to because it's only a matter of time before I hurt myself on the box grater... ðŸ˜¦

Apparently keeping these in the fridge once cooked makes them mushy but they can be frozen in single layers (separated by wax or parchment paper) in an airtight container. Then, reheat right from frozen onto ungreased cookie sheets in an oven preheated to 200C / 400F. This worked for me (they seemed even crispier than the day I made them), and took 15 minutes in my oven.

I've read that you can use brown paper on the cookie sheets to soak up some of the excess oil, but I haven't tried this.
