## Bayerisches Sauerkraut - Bavarian Sauerkraut

## Ingredients
1 lb canned, raw Sauerkraut  
1 medium sized onion, chopped  
3 tablespoons oil  
1 teaspoon salt  
5 juniper berries  
1 – 2 bay leaves  
1 teaspoon caraway seeds  
2 – 3 cups water  
1 medium sized raw potato (optional, but preferable as it helps to bind the mixture)

## Directions
Rinse the sauerkraut under cold water (to remove a bit of the sourness), drain and set aside. In a large pot, heat the oil and sauté the onion until golden brown. Add the sauerkraut, water and seasoning, and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 30 – 45 minutes, or until tender. Ensure that there is always enough water to cover the sauerkraut, adding more during the cooking process if needed.

When tender, adjust seasonings to taste, adding a dash of sugar if it is still too sour. If desired, grate a raw potato, add it to the pot, and simmer for another 5 – 7 minutes to bind everything together. You can also add a grated carrot at this point if you want to give the dish a bit of colour. Some cooked smoked bacon added in will also give it some additional flavour.

Remove the juniper berries and serve.

## My Notes
This can be frozen if you make too much!
