# Semmelknödel – Bread Dumplings

## Ingredients
1 cup milk  
2 – 3 eggs  
3 cups flour  
salt  
6 slices stale bread, broken into chunks

## Directions
Mix ingredients except for bread. Dough must be sticky and come off a wooden spoon with ease. Add pieces of bread and mix well. Wet hands in cold water to form semmelknoedel dumplings. (This recipe usually yields 2 – 3 dumplings.) Cook in salted boiling water for 25 – 30 minutes. Slice and Serve, ideally alongside goulash and a cucumber salad! 😉

## My Notes
This is the recipe I wrote down as I was helping my Oma make knödel one day when I was little. We stopped and measured out the ingredients as we went, but actual volumes can vary. She mixed ingredients "until it looks right", which is not an instinct I have ever developed! 🤷‍♀️

*(I’m adding the umlaut-free spelling of semmelknoedel in here to make it easier to search for this recipe.)*
