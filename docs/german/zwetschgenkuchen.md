# Zwetschgenkuchen – Plum Tart (Cake)
Serves: 6 – 8

## Ingredients
1 lb plums  
5 eggs, separated  
1 cup sugar  
1 cup flour  
1/2 cup good vegetable oil  
vanilla sugar (or vanilla extract)

## Directions
Cut the washed plums into halves and discard the stones. Taste one of the plums — if they are sour, you can sugar them a little bit. In a large bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla sugar (or vanilla extract) thoroughly until the mixture has almost doubled in volume. Add in the vegetable oil slowly and carefully, spoonful by spoonful.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, and set aside. Carefully fold in the flour and the egg whites into the dough mixture. Pour it into a greased and floured flat baking tin or wide, flat baking form (about 1 1/2 inches high)

One by one put the plum halves onto the dough with the skin side down, leaving only one inch spaces between them. Bake in an oven preheated to 340F/180C/Gas Mark 4 for 35 – 40 minutes depending on the thickness of the cake.

After baking, when almost cooled down sprinkle with icing sugar, and serve it with a dollop of whipped cream on the side!

## My Notes
My Oma used to make this with blueberries instead.
