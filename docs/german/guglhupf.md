# Guglhupf - Bundt Cake

## Ingredients
3 eggs  
1 1/2 cups sugar  
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
1/2 cup butter  
1/2 cup milk  
1 teaspoon vanilla sugar  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
2 tablespoons cocoa powder

## Directions
Separate eggs, and set egg whites aside. Combine yolks, sugar, vanilla sugar and butter until doubled in volume. Mix in milk, flour and baking powder. Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks and gently fold in.

Divide the mixture in half and mix the cocoa powder into one portion. Grease a Guglhupf cake mould and fill with the 2 mixtures in turn, spoonful by spoonful.

Bake at 350F / 180C / Gas Mark 4 for about 45 minutes. Cool and serve plain, dusted with powdered sugar and/or with whipped cream.
