# Bratkartoffeln – Sautéed Potatoes
Serves: 4 – 6

## Ingredients
2 lbs potatoes  
1 large onion, chopped  
3 Tablespoons vegetable oil, butter fat or lard  
salt  
pepper  
caraway seeds (whole or ground)

## Directions
Wash potatoes and partially boil them. They should be almost cooked, but still hard at the centre. Drain and set aside. Once cool, peel and slice the potato.

In a large pan, heat oil, add potato slices and fry until brown. Add the onion, salt, pepper and caraway seeds and continue to fry until everything is a nice golden brown.
