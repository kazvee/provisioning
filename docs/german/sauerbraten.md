# Slow Cooker Sauerbraten â€“ German Pot Roast

## Ingredients for the marinade and beef:
1 (3- to-4 pound) beef chuck roast or bottom round roast  
2 cups water  
1 cup dry red wine  
1 cup red wine vinegar  
2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped  
2 medium celery stalks, chopped  
1 medium onion, halved and sliced  
2 cloves garlic, smashed  
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns  
1 tablespoon juniper berries  
1 tablespoon mustard seeds  
2 bay leaves

## Ingredients for searing and finishing the dish: 
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt  
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

## Directions to prepare the marinade:
Combine all ingredients except beef in a large saucepan, and bring to the boil over medium-high heat. Remove from stove, and allow to cook completely. Put the beef into a large non-reactive bowl, and pour the cooled marinade over the meat. The beef will not be completely submerged. Cover bowl, and place in the fridge for 3 â€“ 5 days, flipping the meat once or twice a day.

## Directions to slow cook the roast:
Remove the beef from the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking. Do not discard the marinade. Place beef on a large plate, pat dry with paper towels, and season generously with salt and pepper.  
In a large (preferably cast iron) pan, heat the oil over medium heat, place the beef in the pan and sear on all sides until deeply browned, about 5 minutes per side.

Place the beef in your slow cooker, pour the reserved marinade over it, cover with lid. Cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours or on High for 5 to 6 hours, until the meat is tender and cooked through.

When done cooking, place the meat on a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes. In the meantime, strain the cooking liquid and set 2 cups of it aside. (Discard the solids.)  
Melt butter in a medium saucepan, whisk in the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 or 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the 2 cups of reserved liquid and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Slice the meat and serve hot.

## My Notes
Instead of the whole black peppercorns, juniper berries, and mustard seeds, I used 3 tablespoons of Sauerbraten Spice Mix since it contains all these things (and more) already. I added 2 beef stock cubes to the marinade after I poured it all into the slow cooker. I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken the gravy and kept all the cooking liquids for gravy since we like a lot of sauce. I cooked it for 8 hours on Low.

We really enjoyed this, although the Sauerbraten I am more used to eating is made with just vinegar and spices, no fancy wine or wine vinegar. ðŸ™‚ Will make again.
