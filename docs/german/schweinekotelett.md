# Schweinekotelett – Pork Chops
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
4 pork chops  
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
3 tablespoons flour  
2 tablespoons butter  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 cup stock, broth or water  
2 teaspoons caraway seeds  
2 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoon pepper

## Directions
Rub pork chops with garlic, caraway seeds, salt and pepper. Sift the flour into a large, deep plate, and coat each pork chop with flour. In a large frying pan, heat the vegetable oil and fry chops until golden brown on both sides. Remove from pan and keep warm.

Add butter and 2 tablespoons of the flour to the hot frying pan, stirring on medium heat until the mixture starts to foam. Add stock, and bring to the boil. Add pork chops and simmer for a further 5 minutes.

Serve with fried or boiled potatoes, or white rice.
