# Rindsrouladen in Rahmsosse ‚Äì Beef Rouladen in Cream Sauce
*I guess you could also call these Beef Olives, if you really wanted to.* üòâ

## Ingredients
4 (4 x  8 inch) slices round steak, 1/4 inch thick  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon pepper  
4 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard  
4 slices lean bacon  
1/2 cup onion, finely chopped  
1 large dill pickle, cut lengthwise into 4 spears  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 1/2 cups hot water  
3 tablespoons cream

## Directions
Place one slice of steak on a sheet of waxed paper and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Spead 1 teaspoon of mustard over meat, top with one slice of bacon, and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of onion. Place one pickle spear at one of the 4-inch ends of the meat and roll up meat around it. Secure meat roll with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining slices of meat. Pour 4 tablespoons of flour into a shallow dish. Roll each meat roll in flour until completely covered.

In a large frying pan, heat oil over medium heat for 2 minutes. Carefully place meat rolls in oil with tongs and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until brown on all sides. Preheat oven to 350F/180C/Gas Mark 4. Place meat rolls in a roasting pan, add hot water, and cover pan tightly. Cook for 60 to 90 minutes, or until tender. Place meat rolls on plate, add cream to remaining sauce, stir and use as a gravy.

## My Notes
I used stock instead of water, and added 1/2 a large onion to the stock before it went into the oven, as the meat I had wasn‚Äôt quite large enough to roll up with the onions inside of it. I cooked it for 60 minutes, turning the rolls halfway through, and they came out nice and tender. I had to use 1 ‚Äì 2 tablespoons of flour (mixed with a bit of milk) to thicken the gravy to my liking. I served it with potato salad, and plain boiled rice.

During my last visit to Germany, I bought metal rouladen skewers because I use a cast-iron pan and don‚Äôt need to worry about scratches. üòé  You can also find ‚ÄúRoulade Clips‚Äù which I am tempted to get next time.
