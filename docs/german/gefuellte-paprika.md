# Gefüllte Paprika – Stuffed Bell Peppers
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
4 green bell peppers  
1 lb lean ground meat (beef, pork, lamb or mixed)  
2 eggs  
1 medium onion, finely chopped  
capers, chopped  
mustard  
ketchup  
salt  
pepper  
marjoram  
fresh parsley, chopped  
2 cups tomato sauce (canned tomato, strained through a sieve)

## Directions
Fry the onion in a little oil until golden. In a large bowl, combine meat, eggs, onion and parsley. Season with mustard, a spoonful of ketchup, capers, marjoram, salt and pepper.

Wash the peppers, cut off the tops and set aside. Remove the seeds and the inner white. Fill the peppers with the meat mixture, making sure that it it tightly packed. Replace pepper tops and hold in place with toothpicks.

In a large pot, combine the strained tomatoes with a bit of water. Bring to the boil, then add stuffed peppers, cover and cook on moderate heat for about 15 minutes. Flip the peppers over so that the other halves of them are submerged, and cook for another 15 minutes.

Remove peppers from sauce and keep warm. Bring the sauce to a boil and season with a bit of sugar and salt if necessary. Thicken it as desired, then pour over peppers, and serve with boiled potatoes or rice.

## My Notes
My Oma would always make these with green peppers since that’s what she grew in the garden. Would work equally well with red or yellow peppers.
