# Cremespinat – Creamed Spinach
Serves: 6 as a side dish

## Ingredients
2 lbs fresh spinach  
3 tablespoons butter  
3 tablespoons flour  
2 cups whole milk  
2 cloves garlic, pressed (or very finely chopped)  
1 small onion, finely chopped  
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
Remove spinach stems by twisting or cutting the leaves off just above stem line. Place in a bowl of cold water, making sure to move the leaves around to wash off any dirt or grit, and let them stand in the water for a few minutes while all the dirt sinks to the bottom of the bowl.

Fill a large pot with wated water, and bring it to the boil over high heat. Add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes. Drain into a fine mesh strainer, pressing the leaves with a large spoon to remove as much water as possible. Finely chop the spinach, and set aside.
In a saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of butter on medium to low heat. Sautee the onion, then stir in the flour and salt and stir until creamed together. Add the milk a little at a time, stirring well. Turn up the heat to medium, making sure to whisk constantly so you get a thick, smooth mixture. Remove from heat and set aside.

Add the spinach to the white sauce, add the pressed garlic, and stir well. Cook well for a further 3 minutes.

Season with salt and freshly ground pepper, and serve alongside boiled beef, or sautéed potatoes and a fried egg — as they do on Maundy Thursday (known as Gründonnerstag or “Green Thursday” in Germany)!

If you can find brown butter or nut butter, try adding it to the spinach before it finishes cooking to enhance the taste!
