# Mohnstrudel – Poppy Seed Strudel
Makes: 1 strudel, 8 portions

## Ingredients for the Dough
2 cups wheat flour, all purpose  
1 whole egg  
1/4 cup oil  
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  
1 cup lukewarm water (**Note:** Only prepare 1 cup water, do not use all of it first, but only if needed.)  
Salt  
Flour to work with

## Directions for the Dough
Mix flour, egg, oil, vinegar, water and salt, and knead for at least 5 minutes until the dough is smooth, and not too soft. Place the dough on an oiled plate and coat with a little oil. Cover with foil or a plate and put in a warm place (100F / 38C) to rest for at least 30 minutes.

## Ingredients for the Filling
2 cups (about 7 ounces) poppy seeds, ground  
2 cups milk  
1/2 cup sugar  
2 tablespoons honey  
1/2 cup raisins  
pinch of salt

## Directions for the Filling
Heat the milk in a pot, then add all other ingredients. Stir and cook for 1 – 2 minutes. Cover the pot, remove from heat and set aside. If the filling seems too moist, it should thicken as it rests.

On a large, floured surface, roll the dough until it has reached a thickness of about 3 cm. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 1 inch border. Roll up and brush with a whisked egg. Place the strudel into a baking tin and let it stand for 15 minutes before baking.

Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F / Gas Mark 4 for about 40 minutes. Store for up to 3 days.
