# Knoblauchcremesuppe â€“ Creamy Garlic Soup
Serves: 2 *(Can multiply as needed)*

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons unsalted butter  
10 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed  
1/4 cup sifted flour  
3/4 cup milk  
1 1/2 cup chicken (or vegetable) stock  
2 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus extra to garnish  
2 slices crusty bread

## Directions
Heat the butter in a heavy saucepan on low heat until melted, then add the garlic. SautÃ© lightly for 5 â€“ 10 minutes until it is softened, but not browned. Whisk in the flour to form a thick paste. Add the milk in a slow stream, whisking constantly. Then whisk in the chicken stock. Allow the soup to bubble and thicken, and add more stock if needed.

Add the chopped parsley and stir. Cut the bread into medium cubes and toast in an oven or toaster oven. Garnish with extra parsley and the homemade croutons. (You can also use store-bought!)

## My Notes
Of the recipes I have for this dish, this is my favourite! ðŸ˜‹  
Donâ€™t let the 10 cloves of garlic scare you, this is a really mild and creamy soup! I minced the garlic as finely as I could, but I think next time I want to use a garlic press, because I didnâ€™t like the little chunks of garlic at the bottom of my mug. ðŸ˜‰
