# Zwiebelrostbraten – Steak & Onions
Serves: 2

## Ingredients for the onion rings
1 onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup flour
salt
oil

## Ingredients for the meat
2 boneless rib or rib eye steaks
2 tablespoons English mustard
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon flour or cornstarch
2 cups stock or broth

## Directions for the onion rings
In a bowl, season the onions with salt. Add flour and toss until well coated. Shake off excess flour, then deep-fry the onions until golden brown. Remove from pan and drain on plate lined with paper towels. Set aside and keep warm.

## Directions for the meat
Pound the steaks with a meat tenderizer until they are about 1/4 inch thick. Rub one side of the steaks with mustard, and season with salt and pepper.

In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the steaks quickly on high heat. Brown one side, then flip and fry for a minute or so — meat should be medium-rare. Remove steaks from pan, cover and keep warm.

Add flour to the pan, let it foam a bit, then add the stock or broth, adding some beer or wine if desired. Stir and bring to the boil, before adding the meat and cooking for another 2 – 3 minutes. Place steaks on a plate, adjust sauce seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Serve steaks covered with gravy, and the crispy onions on top.

This meal goes well with baked potatoes, sautéed potatoes, or hash browns. Optionally, serve with a pickled cucumber and a spoonful of mustard on the side.
