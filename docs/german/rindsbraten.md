# Rindsbraten / Rinderbraten – Roast Beef
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
3 lb beef chuck or brisket  
2 carrots  
1 small celery root  
1 parsley root (also called Hamburg parsley or turnip-root parsley)  
1 medium-sized onion  
1 tablespoon mustard  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
2 cups red wine (you can also use dealcoholized wine or a dash of vinegar thinned with water or stock)  
4 cups vegetable or beef broth (water can also be used)  
salt  
pepper  
2 bay leaves  
4 juniper berries  
dry mustard

## Directions
Wash the root vegetables, peel the onion and chop them all into 1 inch pieces. Rub the meat with dry mustard and season with salt and pepper. Fry the meat on all sides in hot oil until meat is coloured and there is juice in the pan.

Remove the meat, add all vegetables and fry them on moderate heat. Add tomato paste and fry for a few more minutes. Add wine and reduce slightly. Scrape the bottom of the pan so it mixes with the wine.

Add 4 cups of broth or water to a pot. Add meat, bay leaf and juniper berries and cover. Cook on moderate heat until the meat is cooked and tender.

Remove meat, bay leaf and juniper berries and purée the gravy in a blender or food processor. Thin the sauce with some broth, water or even milk and cream to reach the desired consistency. Adjust seasoning, cut the meat into slices and pour sauce over it.

Serve with: Carrots and celery root sticks, boiled and sautéed in butter, pasta, boiled potatoes or dumplings.
