# Kartoffelklösse – Potato Dumplings

## Ingredients
1 kg potatoes  
200 grams coarse-grained flour  
50 grams semolina  
2 eggs  
50 grams butter, melted  
Salt

## Directions
Cook potatoes, then peel and put through a ricer or mash. Add the other ingredients, knead into a dough and form golf-ball sized dumplings. Set aside and let rest for 15 minutes.

Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil, add the dumplings, reduce heat, and cook for 10 minutes. Remove one of the dumplings and cut it in two. If the knife doesn’t stick, the dumplings are finished.
