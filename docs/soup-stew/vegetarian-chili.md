# Slow Cooker Vegetarian Chili

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1/2 teaspoon oil  
1/2 medium onion, chopped  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
2 teaspoons coriander  
2 teaspoons cumin  
2 teaspoons chili powder  
1.5 cups water  
1 x 14.5 oz can fire roasted chopped tomatoes  
2.5 cups (17.6 oz) cooked brown or green lentils  
1.5 cups black beans, drained and rinsed  
1.5 cups pinto beans, drained and rinsed  
1/2 teaspoon stoneground mustard  
1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional)  
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)

## Directions
Heat the oil on medium heat in a large pot and saut√© the onion and garlic for a few minutes, until translucent and fragrant. Add in the coriander, cumin, and ancho chili powder, and cook for another 30 seconds or so.  
Pour in the water, chopped tomatoes, lentils, black beans, pinto beans, mustard, hot sauce (if using), and salt. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, until thickened.  
If you want an even thicker texture, use an immersion blender in the pot for 3 to 4 seconds to break up some of the tomatoes and beans.

## My Notes
I used full cans of the beans, rinsed and drained, and didn‚Äôt bother frying the onion or garlic. Threw it all into the slow cooker and left it on Low for 6 hours. I also added in 500g of dry chickpeas that I had soaked overnight, then rinsed and drained. I think I forgot to add in the mustard. Who cares! üòÄ We enjoyed this and the leftovers froze well.
