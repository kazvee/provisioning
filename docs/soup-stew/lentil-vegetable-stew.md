# Lentil Vegetable Stew in Peanut Sauce 

## Ingredients for the Peanut Sauce (or Almond Sauce)
4 tbsp or more peanut butter (or almond butter)  
2 inch piece of fresh ginger, coarsely chopped  
2 cloves garlic  
1 tablespoon soy sauce  
1 to 2 tsp lime juice  
zest of 1/2 a lime  
2 tablespoons coriander/cilantro, chopped  
1/4 teaspoons tamarind concentrate (optional)  
2 to 3 teaspoons (or to taste) Sriracha sauce or Asian chili sauce  
1/4 teaspoon (or more, to taste) cayenne pepper  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1 tablespoon (or more, to taste) sugar  
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil  
1 cup (approx. 226 ml) coconut milk

## Ingredients for the Lentils
1/2 cup (96 grams) red lentils (masoor dal), rinsed and drained  
1.5 cups (approx. 375 ml) water

## Ingredients for the Vegetables
2 teaspoons oil  
1/3 cup onion (red or white), sliced  
1/2 cup red bell pepper, thinly sliced  
1/4 cup carrots, sliced  
1/2 courgette/zucchini, thinly sliced  
1 tablespoon fresh basil, sliced

## Directions for the Peanut Sauce (or Almond Sauce)
In a small bowl, combine all the Peanut Sauce ingredients until smooth. Taste and adjust the saltiness/sweetness/spiciness as per your preference. Cover and set aside. 

## Directions for the Lentils
Boil 1.5 cups of water, add a dash of salt and sugar, and cook the lentils on medium heat for 10 minutes or so, until they’re just about done and no longer crunchy. Once cooked, drain and set aside.

## Directions for the Vegetables
In a large frying pan on medium high, heat the oil and cook the onions until translucent, about 4 – 5 minutes. Add in the bell peppers and carrots, and cook for another 3 minutes or so. Add in the courgette/zucchini and basil. You can also add in some baby greens like spinach, if desired.  
Add the peanut sauce and mix well. Add the lentils and mix in. Reduce heat to medium and bring the sauce to a boil, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the saltiness/sweetness/spiciness as per your preference. If the lentils are not cooked enough to your liking, simmer it a little longer. When done, remove from heat, cover and allow to sit for a few moments, then serve. This is nice over rice, grains, or your choice of wide noodles.

## My Notes
I doubled this recipe so it used 2 carrots, 1 red pepper, 1 courgette, a whole 400 ml can of coconut milk. I used (bottled) lemon juice instead of lime, so no zest. I skipped the chili sauce and went very light on the cayenne pepper. I also added a few teaspoons of Fish Sauce I had in the house.  
I had initially planned to make this meal and add in slices of paneer cheese before serving, however it was filling enough, served with rice alongside, that I’m glad I left the paneer out. We froze the extra for another day.
