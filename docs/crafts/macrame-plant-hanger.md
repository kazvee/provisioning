# Macramé Plant Hanger
*This is just a reminder for myself of what I did for my 2 kitchen plant hangers!*

## Directions
Cut four equal pieces of cord. You can adjust for any length you want. Take a piece of cord that’s the length of your planter and multiply that by two. Add the width of your planter and an additional 24 inches.

Repeat 3 more times.

Fold cords in half, and tie a knot at the top of the fold.

Hang on a doorknob or a hook then take any two cords and tie a knot so you’ll have four separate knots. Make sure they’re all the same distance from the top.

Take two adjacent knots, and one cord from each of those knots and tie them together. Go around and make four knots making sure they’re all at the same level.

Make sure your pot fits. If it doesn’t, adjust that second row.

Make final knot below the pot.

Here’s a photo of my first attempt. I ended up adjusting it so it’d hang lower in my kitchen window, with less of a tassel at the bottom.

For my kitchen window:  
I made the 1st knot 22 inches down, the 2nd knot was made 4 inches lower, the 3rd knot was made 4 inches lower, and the 4th tassel knot was made 4 inches lower.
