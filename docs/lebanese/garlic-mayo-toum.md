# Garlic Mayonnaise – Toum
Tastes great served alongside [Shish Taouk](shish-taouk.md) and rice!

## Ingredients
1 garlic bulb, crushed  
1/2-2/3 cup vegetable oil (not olive oil)  
3 tablespoons mayonnaise  
juice of 1/2 lemon (My Notes: I use 1 tablespoon from the bottle)  
salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions
Place the garlic in a mortar and crush well. Add salt and juice of half a lemon to the crushed garlic and mix well. As soon as the mixture has combined, proceed by slowly adding oil and stirring with a spoon until the oil runs out. Add 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise and mix well. If the sauce has more mayonnaise than needed, you can thin it down by adding some extra olive oil. Season with extra salt and pepper according to taste.

The sauce is ready to use and can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks in a jar.

## My Notes
I have only kept this in the fridge for 3 or 4 days, so I have no idea if it will keep as long as the recipe says it will. This tastes a bit smoother the next day, so I’d recommend making it in advance!
