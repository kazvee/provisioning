# Slow Cooker Hungarian Goulash

I’ve consolidated a few recipes into this one to use in my slow cooker.

## Ingredients
1 kg onions, chopped  
5 bell peppers (red/yellow/orange/green as you prefer), chopped  
1 kg pork or beef (or your meat of choice)  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or your choice of oil)  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
4 cloves garlic, minced (or more, as per your preference)  
1 x 400 gram can chopped tomatoes (and the liquid)  
300 ml beef stock (or chicken stock, or vegetable)  
4 tablespoons sweet paprika (the sweet & smoky kind, not the hot/spicy kind)  
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  
1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (or Maggi seasoning, or soy sauce)  
2 tablespoons tomato paste  
2 teaspoons mixed herbs  
150 ml sour cream

## Directions
In a large frying pan, heat the oil and fry the meat. Set aside for now. Fry the onions until browned, then toss in the garlic and fry for 1-2 more minutes. Place the onions and garlic in the slow cooker. Place the seared meat on top. Add in the chopped peppers. Make a paste with the flour and some of the stock, and stir until it is smooth with no lumps. Combine this with the rest of the stock, the can of tomatoes, and the dried spices. Pour into the slow cooker and stir well to combine. (At this point, you should have everything except the sour cream in the slow cooker.) Cover and cook on High for 4 hours, until the meat is tender and cooked through. When ready to serve, add in the sour cream (a little at a time, so it doesn’t curdle), and serve over noodles or rice.
