# Slow Cooker Chicken Paprikash

Serves: 6 â€“ 8  
Prep Time: 30 minutes  
Cooking time: 4 â€“ 8 hours in slow cooker  
Freezes well  

## Ingredients
8-10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs  
2 teaspoons Hungarian Paprika*  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  
1 large onion, coarsely chopped  
1/3 cup flour  
2 cups chicken broth  
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon (or concentrated stock paste)  
1/2 cup sour cream (you could use light sour cream)  
1 teaspoon flour

## Directions
Coat the chicken in paprika, salt, and pepper, and fry without oil on medium/high heat in a large skillet, until they are nicely browned. Transfer chicken to a slow cooker.

Keep the pan drippings intact and sautÃ© the onion on medium heat for several minutes, adding 1 tablespoon of light olive oil or canola oil to the pan if needed.

Turn the heat off and add the flour, mixing well. Add chicken broth, turn heat back up to medium and stir well until the mixture starts to thicken. Add the bouillon and stir. Pour the thickened broth over the thighs in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.

About 30 minutes before serving, mix the sour cream with 1 teaspoon flour in a separate bowl. Add a few tablespoons of the liquid from the slow cooker to warm up the sour cream mixture to prevent it from curdling. Then add it to the slow cooker and stir well. Continue to cook on low for another 30 minutes.

Serve over wide noodles.

*Hungarian Paprika is dark, smoked, slightly sweet paprika. You can **NOT** use the hot/spicy light red type of paprika as **it will ruin everything**. Donâ€™t say I didnâ€™t warn you. ðŸ˜›

## My Notes
I used boneless chicken breasts and more paprika than in the recipe because it looked like it needed more. For the chicken broth and bouillon I made 2 cups of Oxo stock and then added an extra cube (so 3 cubes total for the 2 cups of water).  
I used probably double the onions because we had them in the house and a bulb of garlic because it needed using and vampires annoy me.  
I didnâ€™t bother adding the flour to the onions in the pan. I just made a flour paste with all the flour and a small amount of stock in a large mug, whisking to get all the lumps out.  
Then added the paste to the stock, stirred well, and poured it all over the fried onions and garlic and chicken in the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  
We really liked this, definitely will make it again. ðŸ™‚
