# Crab Capellini with Chili, Lime, & Green Onion
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
1/2 lb capellini pasta (could also use angel hair pasta)  
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided as per directions below  
2 garlic cloves, crushed or minced  
1 red chili, deseeded & minced – optional (suggestions include serrano chili)  
2 green onions, white & green parts finely chopped, plus some extra for garnish  
1/4 cup white wine  
juice of 1 lime, plus more for garnish  
1/2 lb crab meat (suggestions include king crab, can also use imitation crab meat)  
salt, to taste  
pepper, to taste

## Directions
Boil pasta according to package instructions, until al dente. Drain pasta, set aside, and keep warm. If desired, add (up to) 1 tablespoon olive oil so the pasta doesn’t stick.  
In a large sauté pan over Medium-Low heat, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil and fry the garlic, chili (if using), and green onion for a couple of minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper as preferred.
Add the wine to the pan, increate temperature to Medium and cook for another 2-3 minutes until wine has almost evaporated. Add in the crab meat and lime juice, stirring well to combine. Cook until heated through.  
Add the drained pasta noodles back to the pan, and stir to combine. Garnish with some lime juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and extra green onion before serving.

## My Notes
I used imitation crab meat, and spaghettini noodles. I used bottled lemon juice instead of lime juice. I skipped the chili entirely, and added in about 1/2 cup of fried onions since I had them in the house and I didn’t have enough green onions on hand.
