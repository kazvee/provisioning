# Creamy Mushroom Penne

## Ingredients
350 g penne  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
250 g brown closed cup mushrooms, sliced  
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed  
150 ml dry white wine  
200 pot crème fraîche  
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg  
3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese  
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

## Directions
Bring a large pan of boiling water to the boil. Add the penne and cook for 10 mins or according to packet instructions until al dente.
Whilst the pasta cooks make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large frying pan, when hot add the mushrooms and sauté for 5 mins over a high heat until golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min, stirring.  
Add the white wine and cook briskly until nearly all the wine has evaporated. Add the crème fraîche then gently reheat until the sauce is smooth. Stir in the nutmeg and season to taste. Remove from the heat.  
Drain the penne in a colander then return to the pan. Stir in the mushroom sauce and the cheese. Divide between plates then scatter over the parsley. Serve with more Parmesan cheese if desired.

## My Notes
I don’t use the nutmeg because I hate nutmeg. I also didn’t use parsley. I add a fried onion to the mix, as well as some cooked bacon , chopped into little bits. And we love garlic, so we like it with about 4 garlic cloves instead of the 1.
