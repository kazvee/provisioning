# Lablabi - Chickpea Soup
*I made this in my slow cooker based on a few recipes I found!*

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1.5 cups dry chickpeas, soaked overnight and drained  
1 tablespoon olive oil (plus more for frying)  
1/4 cup olive oil (used later in the recipe)  
1 cup onion, chopped  
6 cloves garlic, minced  
2 bay leaves  
1 tablespoon cumin  
1 tablespoon tomato paste (I use this as it‚Äôs milder than harissa paste)  
1 teaspoon smoked paprika (I used Urban Accents Mesa Rosa Chipotle Seasoning)  
2 vegetable stock cubes, crumbled  
1/2 tablespoon garlic powder  
5 cups water  
3 tablespoons lemon juice

## Directions
In a large frying pan, heat some olive oil and fry the onion and cumin until the onions are softened and golden. Add in the garlic and fry for another few minutes. Deglaze the pan with a bit of water, and pour it all into your slow cooker. Then add the soaked and drained chickpeas, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 5 cups water, stock cubes, bay leaves, tomato paste, paprika, garlic powder, and bay leaves. Cook on High for 4 ‚Äì 5 hours.

After 4 hours, test the chickpeas for tenderness. Once they‚Äôre cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove 2 cups of chickpeas and 1/2 cup of the cooking broth. Combine this with 1/4 cup olive oil in a blender or food processor and pur√©e until smooth. Return the pur√©e to the slow cooker, add the lemon juice, stir well, and serve.  
(You could also just add the 1/4 cup olive oil to the slow cooker and use an immersion blender but it won‚Äôt be as silky smooth.)  
Add water if the soup is too thick, and salt to taste.

## My Notes
I didn‚Äôt have bay leaves when I made this. We really enjoyed it and it freezes well.
