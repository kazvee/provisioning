*This recipe can be scaled up/down as needed.*

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced  
1 large red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced  
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  
1 teaspoon ground cumin  
1 teaspoon sweet paprika  
1/8 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste  
1 (28oz / 800g) can whole plum tomatoes with juices, coarsely chopped  
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste  
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste  
5 ounces (about 1.25 cups) feta cheese, crumbled  
6 large eggs  
Chopped coriander/cilantro, to serve  
Hot sauce, to serve

## Directions
In a large oven-safe pan (or a frying pan with a lid!) over medium-low heat, warm the oil and sautÃ© the onion and bell pepper for about 20 minutes, until very soft. Add in the garlic and cook for 2 minutes or so, until tender. Add in the spices: cumin, paprika, cayenne, and cook for another minute or so. Add in the tomatoes, season with salt & pepper, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Stir in the crumbled feta cheese, make little indentations into the sauce for the eggs, and crack the eggs one by one into the little spaces you prepared. Season again with salt & pepper if needed.  
At this point, you can either:  
â€“ Transfer the pan into an oven preheated to 190C / 375F and bake for 7 â€“ 10 minutes or so, until the eggs are just set.  
â€“ Cover the frying pan with a lid and simmer on the hob for another 10 â€“ 15 minutes or so until the eggs are cooked.  
Once the eggs are cooked to your preference, garnish with coriander, add hot sauce if desired, and serve.

## My Notes
I scaled the recipe to use 4 eggs, but still used 2 x 400gram cans of chopped tomatoes and their juices. I  skipped the peppers, onions, cheese, and hot sauce. Next time I need to let the sauce thicken a little bit more. I made this on the stove, using a glass lid on my pan.  
It used more dishes than necessary, but I cracked the eggs into 4 little ramekins ahead of time, to make it easier for me to pour them into the sauce quickly without risking getting eggshells into everything! ðŸ™„
