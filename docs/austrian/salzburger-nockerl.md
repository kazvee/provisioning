# Salzburger Nockerl – Salzburg Soufflé

## Ingredients
4 teaspoons unsalted butter  
4 teaspoons currant or grape jelly  
9 large egg whites, kept at room-temperature  
1/2 cup vanilla sugar  
zest of 1/2 lemon  
4 egg yolks  
1/4 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour

## Directions
Place four 9-inch oval au gratin dishes (or one large oval glass lasagna pan) on a baking sheet. In each small dish place 1 teaspoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of jelly. (If you are using a lasagna pan, smear the bottom with the butter and then with the jelly).

Mix the egg whites, vanilla sugar and lemon zest with a hand mixer on the high setting until they form stiff peaks.

Beat the egg yolks with the granulated sugar. Gently fold the yolk mixture and the flour into the egg white mixture. Use a spatula to place three large mounds of the mixture into each au gratin dish.

Smooth the surface of each and bake in an over preheated to 230C / 450F / Gas Mark 8 for 8 minutes, until puffed and golden.

Serve immediately with vanilla sauce, warm chocolate sauce or cold strawberry sauce.
