# Carinthian Reindling Cake
ðŸŽ‚

## Ingredients for the Dough
500 grams (2 1/4 cups) flour  
20 grams (3/4 ounce) yeast  
100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) butter  
2 eggs  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon aniseed  
250 ml (1 cup) milk  
50 grams (2 tablespoons) sugar

## Ingredients for the Filling
50 grams (1 3/4 ounces) butter  
100 grams (4 tablespoons) sugar  
2 tablespoons cinnamon  
100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) raisins  
50 grams (1 3/4 ounces) clarified butter (to grease the mould)

## Directions
Warm the milk, add butter and sugar and let the yeast dissolve in it. Mix flour with salt, aniseed, eggs and the milk-yeast mixture and knead well for a few minutes. Form kneaded dough into a round ball, cover the bowl with a clean, damp cloth and set aside in a warm place to rest for 30 minutes to an hour.

Once risen, roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch thick. Brush with melted butter, and sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and raisins. Roll up tightly, form into a spiral and put into your pregreased cake mould. Bake in a NON-preheated oven at 165C / 330F / Gas Mark 3 for about an hour. When done, let the cake cool in the mould, then remove and place on a plate to serve.
