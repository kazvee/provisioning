# Liptauer - Cheese Spread

## Ingredients
1 cup Topfen, Quark, or unaged Farmers’ cheese  
3 ounces butter  
3 tablespoons sour cream  
1 – 2 teaspoons sweet paprika powder  
1 small onion, finely chopped  
2 tablespoons pickled cucumber or gherkins, chopped  
1 tablespoons capers, chopped  
1/2 teaspoon mustard  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
Using a mixer, cream the butter in a large bowl until it is soft and fluffy, and has almost doubled in volume. Add the Topfen, sour cream, paprika, mustard, salt and pepper, and mix well. Add the onion, cucumber or gherkin, and capers, mixing well. Allow to stand in the fridge for a few hours.

Spread this on top of bread for a great snack. For something different, you can also add some freshly chopped chives, and add an extra sprinkle of paprika on top.
