*The Austrian version of bubble and squeak!*

1 large onion, finely chopped  
2 cups beef (leftover roast, sausage, boiled beef)  
2 cups cooked potatoes, sliced or cubed (or cooked pasta, or leftover dumplings)  
1 egg per portion  
marjoram  
chopped parsley or chives  
oil  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
In a large frying pan, fry the onions until golden, then remove, set aside and keep warm. Repeat with the potatoes, and then the meat.
