# Mini Buffalo Chicken Meatballs with Blue Cheese Dressing
Makes: 40 meatballs, and 2 cups (500 ml) dressing

## Ingredients for the Meatballs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
4 tablespoons butter, unsalted  
1/3 cup hot sauce  
1 pound (454 g) ground chicken, preferably thigh meat  
1 large egg  
1/2 celery stalk, minced  
3/4 cup breadcrumbs  
1/2 teaspoon salt

## Ingredients for the Dipping Sauce
3/4 cup sour cream  
1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese  
1/3 cup milk  
1/3 cup mayonnaise  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

## Directions for the Dipping Sauce
Make the blue cheese dipping sauce up to a day ahead by combining all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl, whisking thoroughly until completely combined. Small blue cheese lumps are okay.  
Cover and refrigerate until needed.

## Directions for the Meatballs
In a small saucepan, combine butter and hot sauce, and cook over low heat, whisking until butter is melted and fully incorporated. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool 10 minutes.  
In a large mixing bowl, combine the hot sauce mixture, ground chicken, egg, celery, breadcrumbs and salt; mix well by hand.  
Form the mixture into 3/4-inch (2-cm) firm meatballs. Place close together on a greased baking dish, ensuring meatballs are touching.  
Bake 15 to 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 220C / 425F, until meatballs are cooked through and a meat thermometer inserted into the centre of a meatball reads 74C / 165 F. Allow to cool 5 minutes in the baking dish before serving.
