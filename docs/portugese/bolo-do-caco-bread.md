# Bolo do Caco â€“ Madeiran Bread

## Ingredients
500 grams plain flour (not strong bread flour)  
7 grams Fast Action Yeast  
200 grams sweet potatoes  
1/2 tsp salt  
1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper  
350 ml warm water* (Approx)

## Directions
Cook the unpeeled sweet potato, either for 30 â€“ 40 minutes in the oven or in the microwave for 8 â€“ 10 minutes, depending on the size. When cooked, scoop out the inside and mash gently until smooth.  
In a large bowl, combine the sweet potato and the other ingredients, plus enough warm water to make a very soft and wet dough. Mix well, for 5 to 10 minutes or so, until the dough becomes elastic. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.  
When risen, divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Put a little oil on your hands so the dough doesnâ€™t stick, and shape the dough portions into flattened rounds, and set them aside for another 30 minutes, covered with a damp towel.  
When ready, melt a pat of butter in a frying pan and cook each dough round on low hear for 8 â€“ 10 minutes, until the outside is lightly golden and the bread is cooked through. Repeat with all the remaining dough.

## My Notes
I halved this recipe, and used the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes we get here. I think I made my dough a little too wet since it stuck to the damp towel when I covered the flattened rounds of dough. I used my cast iron pan and it maybe it was a bit too high a heat so next time Iâ€™ll keep it on quite low heat. They came out a bit odd-looking but tasted nice. Not as good as the bread we had in Madeira so I need more practice making these and we need to visit Madeira again. ðŸ™‚
