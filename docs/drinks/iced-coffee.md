# Creamy Iced Coffee

## Ingredients
1 1/2 quarts brewed coffee, room temperature  
1 cup milk  
1 cup half-and-half cream  
1/3 cup white sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
2 tablespoons creme de cacao

## Directions
In a pitcher, combine cooled coffee, milk and half-and-half. Stir in sugar, vanilla and creme de cacao. Chill in refrigerator until ready to serve.

## My Notes
For a 2 litre jug, I just use 6 cups coffee, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and fill the rest of the pitcher with milk. ðŸ™‚
