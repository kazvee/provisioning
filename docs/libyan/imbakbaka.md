# Imbakbaka – Libyan Tomato Stew with Meat & Pasta
Similar to Minestrone, this stew will serve 4 – 5 people

# Ingredients for the 7 Spice Mix 
*This makes 1 teaspoon, of which you need 1/2 to make Bzaar spice mix. The leftover spice mix can be used in other dishes, perhaps on chicken before oven cooking.*  
1/4 teaspoon black pepper  
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin  
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger  
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves  
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander  
1/16 teaspoon ground cardamom  
1/16 teaspoon ground nutmeg

# Ingredients for the Bzaar Spice Mix
*This makes 3 teaspoons, of which you need 2 for this recipe. The leftover spice mix can be used in other dishes, perhaps on chicken before oven cooking.*  
1 1/4 teaspoon turmeric  
3/4 teaspoon caraway seeds, crushed in a mortar and pestle  
1/2 teaspoon coriander  
1/2 teaspoon of the 7 Spice Mix, listed above

# Ingredients for the Imbakbaka
1/4 cup vegetable oil, to fry the meat  
1 kg (2.2 lbs) lamb or beef cubes (could also use chicken)  
2 medium onions, diced  
2 – 3 cloves garlic, minced  
500 grams (1 lb) pasta elbows, rigatoni, macaroni, or shells  
2 – 3 green chili peppers, whole or sliced, deseeded or not, depending on how spicy you like things (optional)  
4 tablespoons tomato paste  
2 – 3 teaspoons Bzaar Mix, listed above  
1 1/2 teaspoons hot paprika (or 1 teaspoon paprika and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper)  
500 ml (17 fl oz) lamb or beef stock  
2 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste

# Directions for the Imbakbaka
In a large pot on high heat, sear the meat (you may need to do this in batches) until browned. Remove from pan and set aside.  
Turn the heat down to medium and sauté the onion for 2 minutes. Add the minced garlic, and cook for a few minutes until they have softened and deglazed the bottom of the pot.  
Return the meat to the pot, as well as any cooking juices. If you are using the chili peppers, and/or want to add any vegetables to the stew, now is the time to add those in.  
Add the tomato paste, paprika, cayenne (if using), Bzaar spices, and salt to the pot. Pour in the stock, which should just cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then turn down to medium and cook, covered, for 45 minutes or so, until the meat is cooked through and tender.

Once the meat is tender, remove and debone (if your meat had bones) before adding back to the stew. Next, add in the pasta.  
**Note:** You do not precook the pasta. Just add it right from the package into the pot. Add in enough hot water (or stock) to the stew to just cover the pasta, and bring to a boil.  
**Note:** You need to use hot water here. If you use cold water, the pasta will stick to the bottom of the pot and you’re gonna have a bad time.
Let the stew boil, stirring every minute or to to prevent the pasta sticking, until the noodled have cooked through and the sauce has thickened a bit. If the sauce thickens too much, adjust with hot water to thin it a bit.

### My Notes:
I halved this recipe. I left out the green chili peppers, and used stewing beef. I cooked it to the point where I should have added the pasta. We’ll reheat the stew later  and do the pasta separate. Since the cut of meat I used took a lot longer than 45 minutes to get tender, the next time I make this, I’ll use the slow cooker — and I will make the entire recipe amount, since this turned out really lovely!
