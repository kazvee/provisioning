# Pork With Mushrooms

# Ingredients
450 g / 1 lb lean pork  
1 tablespoon soy sauce  
1 tablespoon sherry Shaoxing rice wine  
2 tablespoons oil  
115 g (4 oz) fresh mushrooms  
1 teaspoon cornstarch  
1/4 cup stock or water

## Directions
Cut the pork in paper thin slices, add the soy sauce and sherry. Toss well. Heat the oil and fry the meat over fierce heat, stirring all the time, for 2 minutes.

Remove from the pan and keep hot. Wash and dry the mushrooms. Slice them thinly and fry quickly in the remaining fat. Add the meat again and mix well.

Mix the cornflour (cornstarch) to a smooth paste with the stock or water, add to the pan and heat gently, stirring all the time, until slightly thickened.

## My Notes
I used flour instead of cornstarch, 1/2 an Oxo beef cube for the stock, and 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. I also added a head of broccoli, cut into florets that had been blanched. Freezes nicely.
