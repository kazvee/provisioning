# Chicken Curry

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

Slow Cooker Chinese Chicken Curry

## Ingredients
1 kg boneless chicken thighs (could also use chicken breasts)  
2 onions, chopped  
2 cloves garlic, chopped  
2 tablespoons curry powder  
1 tablespoons fenugreek powder  
2 teaspoons light brown sugar  
300 ml chicken stock  
1 tablespoons soy sauce  
3 tablespoonss cornflour

## Directions
Place the onions at the bottom of the slow cooker, and layer the garlic on top.  
In a large bowl, toss the chicken pieces in the cornflower until coated, and layer them on top.  
In a small jug, whisk together the chicken stock, soy sauce, brown sugar, fenugreek, and curry powder. Pour this into the slow cooker.  
Cook on Low for 6-8 hours. (You could also cook this on High for 4-6 hours but then I‚Äôd recommend pre-frying the onions on the stovetop first so they‚Äôre not overpowering, and then following all the other slowcooker steps.)

My Notes: I used chickpea flour instead of cornflour because it‚Äôs what I had in the house. I also added in some other stuff I had leftover from another recipe at the same time as the onions and raw chicken:  
500g carrots, chopped  
1.5 bell peppers (red/yellow/orange), chopped  
125g chestnut mushrooms, quartered  
125g dried chickpeas, presoaked overnight and rinsed and drained  
1 cup caramelised onions that I had in the freezer

My husband enjoyed this and said it was similar to something he‚Äôd had in a restaurant. I think it turned out just okay, and I‚Äôll try a different recipe next time.
