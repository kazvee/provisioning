# Slow Cooker Pork Chops

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
4 pork chops, ideally thick cuts  
1 tablespoon olive oil, to fry the meat  
1/2 teaspoon sweet/smoked paprika  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1 onion, sliced  
2 cups mushrooms, sliced  
1 can cream of mushroom soup  
1 can cream of chicken soup  
3/4 cup beef broth  
salt, to taste  
black pepper, to taste

## Directions
Season the pork with paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and fry in a large pan on medium-high heat until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside. Add the onions to the pan, and saut√© until golden. Remove and place them into the slow cooker. If desired, fry the mushrooms the same way, or alternately just add them into the slow cooker. Place the  seared pork into the slow cooker, on top of the onions and mushrooms. Pour the soup mixtures on top, and cook on low for 7 ‚Äì 8 hours until the pork is tender.

## My Notes
I had 6 boneless pork chops, so scaled the spices to match, but I still used only 2 canned soups. Instead of just beef broth, I used half beef broth (1 cube in 1/4 cup hot water) and 1/4 cup white wine. I also added 3/4 teaspoon onion powder (so for 4 chops, this‚Äôd be 3/4 tsp). Finally, I also used about 1 cup of sliced bell peppers, since I didn‚Äôt quite have enough mushrooms.
