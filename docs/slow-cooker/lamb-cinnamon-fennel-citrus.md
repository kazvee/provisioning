# Slow Cooked Lamb with Cinnamon, Fennel and Citrus
Serves: 4

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1 kg leg of lamb  
1 lemon, juice and zest  
1 orange, juice and zest  
4 tablespoons olive oil  
2 tablespoons clear honey  
1 tablespoon cinnamon  
1 tablespoon fennel seeds  
1 tablespoon ground cumin  
3 garlic cloves, crushed  
1 lamb stock cube (or chicken, or vegetable)

## Directions
Place the lamb into a large food bag or airtight bowl with the lemon and orange juice, and allow to marinade at least 8 hours in the fridge, turning halfway through.

When ready to start the slow cooking, remove the lamb from the marinade (keep the marinade!) and sear in a frying pan with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until nicely browned. Then, coat the lamb with a paste made from the orange and lemon zests, remaining oil, honey, spices and garlic and place in the slow cooker.

Prepare enough lamb (or chicken, or vegetable) stock to fill the slow cooker so about 1/4 of the meat is submerged. Cook in a slow cooker on High for 4 hours.
