# Slow Cooked Rosemary and Garlic Lamb Shanks with Mint Sauce
Serves: 2

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
2 lamb shanks  
4 sprigs rosemary  
2 small onions, thinly sliced  
4 ‚Äì 5 garlic cloves, crushed  
1 chicken stock cube, crushed  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions
Remove the rosemary leaves from the stalks, and roughly chop. Place the onions and garlic into the slow cooker, and sprinkle the stock cube and rosemary on top. Heat the oil in a frying pan on high heat, and sear the lamb until nicely browned. Nestle the lamb on top of the onions and garlic in the slow cooker, add hot water until about 1/4 of the way up, and cook on High for 4 hours. Serve with [homemade Mint Sauce](../sauce-gravy/mint-sauce.md).

If you need to do the lamb in the oven, suggested time and temperatures are 150C (fan-assisted)/ 170C / Gas Mark 3, but I haven‚Äôt tried this.
