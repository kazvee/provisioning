# Slow Cooked Lamb with Orange and Rosemary
Serves: 4

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1 kg (2.2 lbs) leg of lamb  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary  
4 tablespoons fresh orange juice  
1 orange, zested  
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  
1/2 cup olive oil  
4 tablespoons honey  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
5 bay leaves  
onions, sliced  
1 stock cube (lamb, vegetable, or chicken flavour)  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
In a large bowl, combine the rosemary, orange juice, orange zest, lemon juice, olive oil, honey, garlic, and bay leaves and whisk well. Place the lamb into the marinade, cover with plastic wrap or an airtight lid, and leave in the fridge for at least 8 hours, turning it over halfway through.  
When ready to start the slow cooking, remove the lamb from the marinade (keep the marinade!) and sear in a frying pan until nicely browned. Place it in a slow cooker with the onions, sprinkle the stock cube on top and pour hot water over until 1/4 of the way up.  
Cook in a slow cooker for 4 hours on High. (Oven directions seem to suggest 3 hours at 150C Fan / 170C / Gas Mark 3, but I haven't tried this.)

## My Notes
I had to skip the orange zest, and used bottled orange and lemon juice, but this still turned out great. üôÇ  
This marinade should also work with lamb chops, marinated for 1 to 6 hours and done on the grill.
