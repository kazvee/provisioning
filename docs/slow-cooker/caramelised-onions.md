# Caramelised Onions in the Slow Cooker
*Not really caramelised but a reasonable lazy alternative!*

## Ingredients
2 kg onions (or up to 3kg, depending on what makes your slowcooker 3/4 full)  
2 tablespoons olive oil (apparently you can use butter/margarine/canola oil too)

## Directions
Slice the onions into very thin half-moons. Use normal onions, not red or purple onions or those large sweet vidalia ones or anything since apparently they may have too much water.

Use 1 tablespoon of the oil to grease the bottom and about 3/4 of the way up along the sides of your slowcooker.  
Add in the onions, pour the remaining 1 tablespoons oil on top, and stir lightly to coat the onions in oil.

Cover and cook on Low for 10 hours, checking halfway through if possible, and stirring as some of the onions on the sides may get quite dark.

After 10 hours, check and stir, if there's a lot of liquid then prop the lid open with a wooden spoon or chopsticks or something (or take the lid off entirely) to let the moisture out and cook (on Low still) for another 2-3 hours, stirring every hour or so, until the onions are the dark colour and the consistency you prefer.

Cool, divide and keep in fridge for a few days or put into ice cube trays and freeze to add to stews, soups, etc. later.

## My Notes
First time I made this, 2kg of raw onions cooked down to 900 grams or so of caramelised ones. 

The 2nd time I made these, I used 3kg of onions in my 6.5 litre slowcooker, which filled it over 3/4 but not completely full, so 4kg of onions wouldn't fit in there. I started the slowcooker at 11pm and stirred it for the first time the next morning at 6am. I propped the lid open for the last hour or so of cooking time to get rid of some of the accumulated water.

Next time I'll try starting the slowcooker in the evening, on High and propped open for the first couple of hours to get rid of some of the liquid. Then when it's bedtime, stir, cover, and set to Low.
