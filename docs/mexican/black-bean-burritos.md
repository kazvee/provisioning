# Black Bean Burritos

## Ingredients
2 (10 inch) flour tortillas  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 small onion, chopped  
1/2 red pepper, chopped  
1 teaspoon minced garlic  
1 400 gram (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained  
1 teaspoon jalapeÃ±o chilli peppers, minced  
85 grams (3 ounces) cream cheese  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander

## Directions
Preheat the tortillas, wrapped in foil, in an oven heated to 175C / 350F for 15 minutes or until warmed through.  
In a large pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Fry the onion, pepper, garlic, and chilli peppers for a few minutes, then add the drained black beans and cook for another few minutes until well-heated. Add cream cheese cubes and cook for another few minutes, stirring every so often. Add fresh coriander and remove from heat.  
Spoon black bean filling into the warmed tortillas, roll, and serve.

## My Notes
We used Aycan brand curry flavoured tortilla wraps and I didnâ€™t warm them in the oven. I skipped the coriander, salt, and cream cheese. Instead, I added a few cubes of truffle Gouda that we had in the fridge and some homemade pickled turnips. Next time Iâ€™d probably add a tablespoon or so of tomato paste to the mix while itâ€™s cooking. My husband added some reheated leftover white rice to his burritos. We enjoyed this as a quick and easy mid-workweek dinner. ðŸ™‚

## More Notes
Iâ€™ve made other batches to freeze. Tips included to make sure all fillings are room-temperature before rolling the tortillas. Eggs cooked as one solid piece and then sliced for portioning reheat better than scrambled (which apparently can get rubbery). Once rolled, wrap in a paper towel then clingfilm to prepare for freezing.  
To reheat from frozen, remove the clingfilm and leave in the paper towel, microwaving for 2 â€“ 3 min or until heated through, taking care not to reheat for too long.
