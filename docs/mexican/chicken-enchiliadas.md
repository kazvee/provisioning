# Chicken Enchiladas

## Ingredients
2 cups leftover chicken, diced  
2.5 cups enchilada sauce, divided (Make your own sauce [here](enchilada-sauce-1) or [here](enchilada-sauce-2).)  
1.5 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided  
1/2 cup sour cream  
1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped  
1 x 115 g (4 oz) can of diced green chilies  
12 x 15 cm (6 inch) flour tortillas

## Directions
Warm the tortillas in the oven or microwave to make them softer and easier to roll. In a large bowl, mix chicken, 1/2 cup of your preferred enchilada sauce, 1/2 cheese, sour cream, and the diced chilies.  
Pour about 1/4 cup of your enchilada sauce at the bottom of your pan. Then, lay out each tortilla, place about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture in the middle, and roll. Place in the pan seam side down. Continue with all tortillas.  
Pour the remaining enchilada sauce on top, sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top.

At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the enchiladas for up to 1 day. Or you can put them in the freezer, to bake directly from frozen at another time.

### If Cooking Right Away
Place the enchiladas (uncovered) in an oven preheated to 190C/375F for 15-20 minutes, or until bubbly and cooked through.

### If Cooking from Frozen
No need to thaw these! They go right from the freezer into the oven! Cook, covered with foil, in an oven preheated to 190C/375F for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 5 â€“ 10 minutes or until cooked through.

## My Notes
I donâ€™t usually buy canned chilies, so I used 115 grams total of a mix of some previously-sautÃ©ed onions and bell peppers I had leftover from something else. This recipe should have made about 8 enchiladas, across 4 of my rectangle loaf tins. But I mucked up the filling portioning so weâ€™ve got 4 smaller sized enchiladas across 2 loaf tins, and 2 giant superfilled enchiladas in a single loaf tin. Weâ€™ll have a side salad with the smaller ones, I guess. ðŸ™‚ I made all of these to freeze right away, so we have quick and easy freezer-to-oven meals for worknights!
