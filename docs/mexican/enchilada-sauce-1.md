# Enchilada Sauce

## Ingredients
1/4 cup olive oil  
2 tablespoons flour  
3 tablespoons chili powder (*Adjust to your taste!)  
1 cup chicken stock  
2 x 400g can (1 x 28oz can) crushed tomatoes  
1 teaspoon dried oregano  
1 teaspoon cumin powder  
1 teaspoon garlic powder  
1 teaspoon onion powder  
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar (optional)  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
Salt, to taste  
Pepper, to taste

## Directions
Heat the oil on medium heat and add in the flour, whisking while they cook until you get a smooth paste. Once it bubbles, ad in the other ingredients and whisk until you get a smooth sauce. Simmer until desired thickness (this won’t take long), and season to taste. You can use this sauce right away or refrigerate/freeze for another day.

## My Notes
I skipped the chicken stock and 1 of the cans of tomato (because I’d written down the recipe wrong!). I also didn’t have onion powder in the house. I also added 1 teaspoon thyme because I didn’t think I had oregano in the house, but then I found the oregano spice bottle so added it in as well. I only used 1/8 teaspoon Kashmiri chili powder because I can’t handle more than that. This turned out quite mild.
