# Enchilada Sauce
(Makes about 2 cups of sauce)

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon ground chili powder (*Adjust to your taste!)
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
Pinch of cinnamon (optional but recommended)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
2 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar
Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste

## Directions
Get your mise en place done for all ingredients, because the sauce doesn’t take long to make at all once the stove is on.  
In a medium sized pot, heat the oil on medium heat, then throw in the flour and the spices, whisking well until you get a smooth paste, and cook for a minute or two.  
Slowly add in the broth, whisking well, to ensure you get a smooth sauce. Simmer for 5 – 8 minutes or so, until the sauce thickens up a bit.  
Remove from heat, add in the vinegar and season to taste. You can use this sauce right away or refrigerate/freeze for another day.

## My Notes
I only used 1/8 teaspoon Kashmiri chili powder, and I used Apple Cider Vinegar. I think I preferred this sauce more than [my other recipe](enchilada-sauce-1.md) (but that could be because I’d actually written down this recipe properly!).

Here is my [chicken enchiladas recipe](chicken-enchiladas.md).
