# Brown Lentil Curry
*Recipe idea off the back of a bag of lentils!*

## Ingredients
300g brown lentils  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
4 garlic cloves, sliced  
1 carrot, finely diced  
1 celery stick, finely diced  
2 shallots, finely diced  
1 teaspoon sage  
1 teaspoon cumin seeds  
190ml to 240ml vegetable stock  
1 lemon  
1 handful fresh parsley, chopped  
salt and pepper to taste

## Directions
Rinse the lentils, and parboil them in lightly salted water for 25 minutes. Drain, and set aside for now.  
In a frying pan, heat the olive oil and fry the cumin seeds for 1 minute until they begin to crackle. Then add garlic and fry for 1 more minute. Add the shallots, carrots, and celery and saut√© for 5 minutes. Add in the rest of the dried herbs, and pour in 190ml of the vegetable stock. Bring to boil, then add in the parboiled lentils. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for another 10 minutes or so. Add the rest of the stock if desired. Garnish with a squeeze of lemon juice and the fresh parsley.
