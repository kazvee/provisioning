# Papad Ki Subji â€“ Rajasthani Poppadom Curry
Serves: 2

## Ingredients
4 plain poppadoms (8â€³ in diameter)  
2 tablespoons oil  
1 teaspoon cumin seeds  
1/8 teaspoon asafoetida  
2 whole red chilis, dried  
2 cups (500 grams) yogurt (plain, full fat)  
2 teaspoons ginger, finely shredded  
1 teaspoon red chili powder  
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder  
2 teaspoons coriander powder  
1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds  
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste  
2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander

## Directions
To reduce the bitterness of the fenugreek seeds, rinse them and leave them to soak in fresh water for about 5 minutes, making sure to change the water 3 or 4 times during this period. Drain and set aside for now.  
Break the (uncooked) poppadoms into medium-sized pieces and set aside for now.  
In a medium bowl, whisk the yoghurt until smooth and blend in the fresh ginger, turmeric, coriander powder, and the drained fenugreek leaves. Stir until it is well-combined.  
Heat the oil in a large saucepan on medium heat, and add the cumin seeds and once they begin crackling, add in the asafoetida and chilies.  
Reduce heat and add in the yoghurt mix â€” carefully so it doesnâ€™t split. Heat for up to 5 minutes. Add about 1 cup of water (or however much to thin the gravy to your preference).  
Add salt to taste, pour in the poppadoms and mix well. Cook on low for up to 5 minutes then add your fresh coriander and serve.

## My Notes
I didnâ€™t use dried chili, but I added 2 (deseeded) chopped fresh red chilies instead. I didnâ€™t have fenugreek seeds, so I skipped that step and instead added about a teaspoon of crumbled dried fenugreek leaves as I added the poppadoms in. I donâ€™t usually use chili powder since I canâ€™t eat spicy foods so I substituted 1 teaspoon of tikka masala spice blend instead.  
We enjoyed this despite my sauce splitting. ðŸ˜¦ Apparently adding 2 teaspoons to the yoghurt, whisking it well, and allowing it to get to room temperature before pouring it into the only-warm curry mix would help prevent splitting â€” Iâ€™ll try this next time!  
Some recipes say you can cook the poppadoms first and then break up and add them. Iâ€™ll try this next time, too.
