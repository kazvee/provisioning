# Chicken Korma

## Ingredients
4 chicken breast fillets (about 600g)  
2 tablespoons sunflower or vegetable oil  
40g butter  
2 brown onions, very finely chopped  
4 teaspoons garlic and ginger paste  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
2 teaspoons ground coriander  
1 teaspoon ground turmeric  
1/4 teaspoon mild chili powder  
2 tablespoons mango chutney  
300 ml hot chicken stock  
100 ml double cream  
toasted flaked almonds and fresh coriander leaves (to garnish)

## Directions

Chop the chicken breast into 2.5 cm (approx) chunks and season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick frying pan set to medium high heat and fry the chicken for 5 minutes or so, turning occasionally. Remove from the pan, cover and keep warm. Add the remaining oil to the pan, along with the butter and onions, cooking over a medium high heat and stirring occasionally until the onions are soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes or so.  
Stir in the ginger garlic paste and the ground spices and stir for another minute or two.  
Add in the mango chutney and chicken stock and simmer, stirring regularly, for about 5 minutes or so, until the liquid has reduced by about half. (If you want an extra smooth sauce, let it cool to a safe temperature to use a blender on.)  
Add the chicken into the sauce, add the cream in and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minute or so until the chicken is piping hot and cooked throughout. Add a splash of water if you feel the sauce is too thick. Garnish with toasted almond flakes and fresh coriander, and serve with freshly cooked basmati rice or naan.

## My Notes
This one isn’t a slow cooker recipe (yet!), but it’s easily adaptable if we like the result.
