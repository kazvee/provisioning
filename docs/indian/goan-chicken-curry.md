# Goan Chicken Curry

## Ingredients
4 large skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks  
3 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 teaspoon yellow or brown mustard seeds  
1 large onion, sliced  
3 garlic cloves, finely sliced  
1 x 400 ml can coconut milk  
salt, to taste

## For The Marinade
1 teaspoon paprika  
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric  
1 1/2 tablespoons ground coriander  
1 teaspoon ground cumin  
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
75 ml (2 3/4 fl oz) water

## Directions
Combine all the marinade ingredients to create a loose, smooth paste. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Marinade for 30 minutes to an hour.

In a deep frying pan, heat the oil and add the mustard seed. When the seeds start to pop, add the onion and garlic and cook until golden brown. Add chicken, any leftover paste from the marinade, and fry over a medium heat for 8 â€“ 10 minutes, before adding the coconut milk.

Increase the heat slightly and allow to simmer for another 10 â€“ 12 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly. Season to taste and serve with rice and/or naan bread.

## My Notes
The mustard seeds popped, jumped about in the pan, and then jumped out of the pan and onto me which was not so much fun. Closer attention to be paid next time! ðŸ˜‰ This was lovely though! Freezes well.
