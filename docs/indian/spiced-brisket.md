# Slow Cooked Spiced Brisket

## Ingredients
1 kg beef brisket  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 large onion  
5 garlic cloves, pureed  
1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled and grated  
1 tablespoon garam masala  
2 teaspoons turmeric  
3 teaspoons cumin  
3 teaspoons ground coriander  
1 (400g) tin chopped tomatoes  
1 beef stock cube, crumbled (or if doing this in a traditional oven: 500 ml beef stock)  
2 red chilies, finely chopped (optional)  

## Directons
Sear the meat in a large frying pan on Medium heat, then place in the slow cooker.  
Fry the onions for 5 minutes until soft but only just starting to turn golden. Add the garlic, ginger, and chili (if using), and fry for another couple of minutes. Empty the pan contents into the slow cooker, on top of the beef.  
Deglaze the frying pan with the beef stock and tomatoes. Add the spices in, stir through and let this warm for a minute or so, then pour the mixture on top of the brisket in the slow cooker.  
Turn the slow cooker on Low and cook for 8 hours.

## My Notes
I put a few potatoes and carrots at the bottom of the slow cooker, underneath the seared meat. To thicken the gravy, I took the meat and vegetables out of the slow cooker, then added in a few tablespoons of gram flour (chickpea flour) and let that simmer on Low for another 30min with the lid propped open slightly, but cornstarch or flour would also have worked. We enjoyed this, the potatoes especially soaked up a lot of the flavours from the spices. Definitely one weâ€™ll make again when we have all the fixings for a roast beef dinner but want something a little more interesting.
