# Slow Cooker Red Lentil & Butternut Squash Curry

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil  
2 small yellow onions, diced  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes  
1 1/2 cups dry red lentils, rinsed and picked through  
1 x (400 ml) can coconut milk  
1 x (796 ml) can diced tomatoes  
1 tablespoon turmeric  
1 tablespoon curry powder  
1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon pepper  
2 cups spinach, chopped  
Coriander/cilantro leaves, for garnish  
Sesame seeds, for garnish

## Directions
Place the ingredients (except for the spinach & garnishes) into the slow cooker in the order listed above.  
Cook on High for 4 hours, or Low for 8 hours.  
At the end of the cooking time, add in the spinach, stir and allow to wilt, then add garnishing and serve.

## My Notes
I left out the spinach, since I only had frozen in the house and wasn’t sure it’d work. Instead of the turmeric, curry powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper, I used 1/2 a jar (135 ml) of Thai Red Curry Paste. This made 10 portions, and freezes well.  
We enjoyed this more than the other red lentil curry recipe I have for the slow cooker…
