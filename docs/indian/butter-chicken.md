# Butter Chicken

## Ingredients
1 ounce butter  
1 onion, chopped  
1 clove garlic, crushed  
2 large boneless chicken breasts  
1 teaspoon ginger  
1 teaspoon chili powder  
1 teaspoon turmeric  
1 teaspoon cinnamon  
1 teaspoon salt  
3/4 cup fresh cream  
1 tablespoon tomato paste  
1/2 teaspoon garam masala  
2 ‚Äì 3 red chili peppers (optional)

## Directions
Cut chicken into slices or cubes, add the ginger, chili powder, turmeric, cinnamon, and salt. Mix until the meat is well-coated, and set aside for now.  
In a large pot, melt the butter and fry the onions, garlic, and chilli peppers (if using). Add in the chicken and fry until browned.  
Add in the tomato paste and cream, stir well, and cover to simmer until the chicken is cooked throughout. Remove from heat, add in the garam masala, stir, and serve.

## Note
Another spice combination to try: omit the cinnamon and ginger, and instead use 1 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 teaspoon cumin.

## My Notes:
This is one of our favourite meals! üòç  
When I first started making it, it seemed like it was missing something, so I usually add a few red chillies (fried with the onions).  
On a more recent version I used a can (400 ml / 14 oz) of coconut milk instead of the cream, and I added 2 ‚Äì 3 tablespoons of dried fenugreek leaves.
