# Chicken Tikka Masala
Serves: 6

## Ingredients for the Marinade
1 kg (2.2 lbs) boneless chicken thighs (or breasts if you prefer)  
1 cup plain yogurt  
1 tablespoon ginger, grated  
1 tablespoon garlic, minced  
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (optional)  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon ground pepper

## Ingredients for the Sauce
1.5 kg (about 3 lbs) tomatoes  
2 whole chilli peppers, chopped  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
2 tablespoons tomato paste  
1 tablespoon grated ginger  
1 tablespoon minced garlic  
1 teaspoon garam masala  
1 teaspoon paprika  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon sugar

## Directions for the Marinade
Combine all marinade ingredients in a medium bowl, add the chicken, and stir well to coat. Cover and place in the fridge for an hour or overnight (depending on how much time you have).

## Directions for the Chicken
You can either cook the chicken on the grill, in a frying pan, or in the oven and set aside to put into the sauce later. Or you can add it to the purÃ©ed sauce later on if you prefer.

## Directions for the Sauce:
In a large pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add in garlic, ginger, chillies, tomato paste, and all spices (except for garam masala). Cook for a few minutes and then add in the tomatoes. Cook for another 5 minutes or so, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or so. Allow the sauce to cool enough that you can safely put into into a blender or use a stick blender to get a smooth purÃ©e.

If you cooked the chicken ahead of time, add it in now and simmer for a few minutes until warmed through.  
If your chicken is still raw and in the marinade, place it (and the marinade mix) into the sauce at this point and simmer until the chicken is cooked throughout (usually about 45 minutes or so).

## My Notes
I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh. I fried the chicken in a pan separately and then added it to the gravy. I also added some yoghurt to the gravy just because I had it left over from the tub Iâ€™d bought to prepare the marinade. This is definitely something Iâ€™d want to make again with fresh tomatoes. ðŸ™‚  
This freezes nicely to reheat in the microwave during the work week.
