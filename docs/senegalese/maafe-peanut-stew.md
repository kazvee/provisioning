# Maafé (Peanut Stew)

# Ingredients
2 lbs stewing beef, chopped into smaller pieces  
1 onion, chopped  
1 red bell pepper, chopped  
1/2 cup peanut butter  
2 tablespoons tomato paste  
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or to taste)  
1/4 cup olive oil  
1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)  
1 teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)  
1 cup water  
2 cups stock / beef broth  
1 tablespoon beef stock / beef bouillon powder (Like Knorr brand, for example)

# Directions
Heat the oil in a large pan on medium heat and sauté the beef, seasoned with half the pepper and a pinch of salt, for 8 to 10 minutes.  
Add the onions, and bell pepper to the pan and sauté for another few minutes, until softened.  
Add in the tomato paste, stir, and cook for about 5 minutes more.  
Pour in the water, stock, bouillon powder, cayenne pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes or so.  
Add peanut butter and stir until dissolved. Simmer on Low for another 5 minutes, until thickened. If needed, the sauce can be thinned out with a bit of water.

### My Notes
I halved this recipe and used 1 lb (450 grams) of ground beef instead of stewing meat. I fried the mince then drained it before returning it to the pan and carrying on with the recipe. I didn’t have beef stock or beef bouillon powder in the house so used 1.5 cups of water with 3/4 of a chicken stock cube I had floating around. I also used 1 canned tomato and some of the tomato juices from the can, since I had it in the fridge. Instead of cayenne pepper I used 1/2 teaspoon of Kashmiri chili powder. This made 4 meals for us (smaller portions).
