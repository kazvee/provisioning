# Kanelbullar â€“ Swedish Cinnamon Buns
Makes: 12

## Ingredients for the Dough
2 teaspoons instant yeast  
50 grams sugar  
60 grams butter  
150 ml milk  
1 egg (whisked and separated into 2 parts)  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 heaping teaspoon freshly ground cardamom  
325 grams flour

## Ingredients for the Filling
60 grams softened butter  
60 grams sugar  
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Directions for the Filling
Simples â€“ mix all the ingredients in a bowl until smooth.

## Directions for the Dough
Whisk the egg, then remove half and set aside for later, to glaze the rolls before they go into the oven. In a large bowl, combine the flour and butter and rub until combined. Add the salt, sugar, cardamom and yeast and mix. In a separate bowl, combine milk and the remaining half egg portion, then pour into the dry ingredients. Combine well with a spoon and then work with your hands at least 5 minutes to get a smooth, stretchy, silky dough. Leave the dough to rise in a warm spot for at least an hour, until doubled in size.

Punch down the dough, and knead for 2-3 minutes. Then turn it onto a floured surface and roll into a large rectangle, to get the dough about 1/2 cm (1/4 inch) thick. Spread the filling over, then roll lengthwise. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll onto 12 slices.

Lay each slice cut face up in your baking tray, and cover with clingfilm or a damp teatowel, and let rise for about an hour or until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 210Â°C. Combine the remaining half an egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the buns with the mixture. Sprinkle the tops with pearl sugar and bake for about 6 minutes, or until nice and golden.

## My Notes
Took about 8 min in my 190C fan-assisted oven. I didnâ€™t have pearl sugar so used crushed peanuts to make them more interesting. Not the most photogenic but they tasted fab! ðŸ™‚
