# Ärtsoppa - Slow Cooker Yellow Pea Soup

## Ingredients 
500 grams dried yellow peas  
500 grams salted pork loin  
1 tablespoon thyme  
1 tablespoon marjoram  
2 cubes beef stock  
1 carrot, peeled and sliced or grated  
1 onion, chopped  
1.5 liters water  
Mustard (the grainy kind, to taste, when served)  

## Directions
If preferred, fry the onion first. Place all ingredients in a slow cooker, and set to High for 8 hours.

## My Notes
I used dried split yellow peas, not whole ones. I used an onion I had already sautéed ahead of time, double the amount of carrots, and about 6 slices of already-cooked smoked bacon instead of pork loin. Also, based on some other recipes I’d seen, I added in 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger, and 4 juniper berries. (instead of the allspice berries I’d seen mentioned). This took 7 hours on High in my slow cooker. I was expecting to have to thicken it with a hand blender, but it seemed to have the right consistency already.
