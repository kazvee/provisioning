# Svenska Köttbullar – Swedish Meatballs
Makes: About 50 meatballs

## Ingredients
250 grams minced beef  
250 grams minced pork  
1 egg  
200 – 300 ml cream and water (or milk and water) (**My Notes**: The amount of liquid actually needed will vary. Start with a small amount (say, 50 ml), and increase if necessary!)  
2 1/2 tablespoons onion, finely chopped  
50 ml unsweetened rusk flour (or breadcrumbs, or toasted breadcrumbs)  
2 (small) cold boiled potatoes  
4 – 5 tablespoons butter, margarine or oil  
Salt  
White pepper  
Allspice

## Directions
Heat the onion till golden in a couple of tablespoons of lightly browned butter. Mash the potatoes and moisten the rusk flour in a little water.

Mix all the ingredients until there is consistency and flavour generously with salt, white pepper and (optional) a little finely crushed allspice. Use a pair of spoons (or your hands) to shape the mixture into relatively large, round balls and transfer to a floured chopping board. Fry them slowly in plenty of butter.

## To make the cream sauce:
100 ml cream  
200 ml beef stock (or water)  
Soya sauce  
1 tablespoon white flour  
Salt  
White pepper

Swirl the boiling water or beef stock in a pan. Add cream and thicken with white flour if preferred. Season well with salt and white pepper.

Serve the meatballs with the sauce, freshly boiled potatoes, uncooked lingonberry jam and salad.
