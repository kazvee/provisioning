# Cauliflower Rice
*This isn’t even a recipe it’s just a reminder to myself!*

Cut the cauliflower into quarters and wash. Blitz in food processor on the grater attachment to make rice-sized pieces. Can then be frozen or microwaved (covered) for 4 to 5 minutes (stirring occasionally) until cooked. No need to add water.

Apparently you’re supposed to remove the stalk and discard it. I guess if it’s quite thick and tough on the outside, then go ahead (Or save it for making soup?) I didn’t bother and you can see bits of stalk in the photos but it didn’t affect the taste at all.

I froze the extra and we microwaved it right from frozen. Just as good as fresh, but I wouldn’t leave it in the freezer too long.
