# Spinach Dip

## Ingredients
300 grams (10 oz) frozen chopped spinach, cooked, cooled and squeezed dry  
500 ml (16 oz) sour cream  
1 cup mayonnaise  
1 package (40 grams) vegetable soup/dip mix  
1 x 227 ml can (8 oz) water chestnuts, drained and chopped (optional)  
3 green onions, chopped (optional)  

## Directions
Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, cover, and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.

## My Notes
Sometimes we use generic onion soup/dip mix but I prefer it with veg soup mix, though. Even broccoli soup mix in a pinch. Iâ€™ve also used up to 500g frozen spinach, depending on the size of the package. We also like radishes in place of the water chestnuts.
