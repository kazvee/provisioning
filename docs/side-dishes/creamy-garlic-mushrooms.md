# Creamy Garlic Mushrooms
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter (preferably unsalted)  
3 cloves minced garlic  
450 grams (16 ounces) Chestnut mushrooms  
1/3 cup double cream  
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  
2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley  
freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
salt, to taste

## Directions
Melt butter in a large pan on medium heat and add the garlic and mushrooms and fry until tender and browned.  
Add the cream and spices and mix well. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the sauce has thickened.  
Remove from heat, stir in the Parmesan, garnish with parsley leaves, and serve.

## My Notes
This isnâ€™t quite a recreation of the creamy garlic mushrooms at my favourite buffet restaurant, but they still turned out really nice.
