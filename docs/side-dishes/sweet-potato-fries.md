# Baked Sweet Potato Fries / Chips

## Ingredients
sweet potatoes  
olive oil  
seasonings to taste  

## Directions
Slice up the sweet potato into long rectangular strips about 1cm wide. Drizzle them with olive oil, and any other seasonings that strike your fancy. (Fresh thyme, chili powder, cracked pepper & sea salt)

Bake in an oven preheated to 200C / 400F / Gas Mark 6 for about 40 minutes, making sure to check on them at 10 minute intervals. Remove from oven when golden brown. Toss with more seasonings if desired (more sea salt, or chopped parsley). Serve & enjoy!

## My Notes
They’re a little mushier than proper fries / chips, but they’re healthier, and taste fantastic.
