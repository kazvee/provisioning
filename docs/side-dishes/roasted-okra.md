# Roasted Okra

## Ingredients
18 fresh okra pods, sliced 1/3 inch thick  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
2 teaspoons (or to taste) kosher salt  
2 teaspoons (or to taste) black pepper

## Directions
Place the okra slices on a foil-lined baking sheet, making sure not to stack them. Drizzle with oil, season to taste, and place in an oven preheated to 220C / 425F. Bake for 10 – 15 minutes.

## My Notes
Apparently, to reduce the sliminess of okra, it’s best to wash, dry, and then slice them right before you use them, so that's what I did. I quickly tossed the slices in the olive oil and some salt & chilli spice mix, then put them on a non-foil-lined cookie sheet.
