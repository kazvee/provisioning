# Coleslaw
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
6 cups shredded cabbage  
1 carrot, shredded  
2/3 cup mayonnaise  
2 tablespoons vinegar  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, or to taste  
1/2 teaspoon celery salt  
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste

## Directions
Toss cabbage in a large bowl with the carrots. In a bowl, whisk together the remaining ingredients. Pour the mixture over the cabbage and carrots and toss to coat thoroughly. Refrigerate until serving time.

## My Notes
I didn’t use the celery salt, or the salt, and I used only half the sugar.

I have also made this using only shredded carrots, I just didn’t add any sugar, or celery salt.

Latest attempt was a very lazy version of this with broccoli: 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and mayo to suit my taste. Yum!
