# Polenta
Makes: 5 servings of 3/4 cup (175ml) each  
*(This recipe can be halved.)*

## Ingredients
4 cups (1 litre) water  
1 tsp (5 ml) salt  
1 cup (250 ml) cornmeal

## Directions
Bring water and salt to a boil. Sprinkle in the cornmeal, a little at a time, while whisking constantly. Simmer on low heat, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes or until you have the desired consistency. Season to taste and serve.

## My Notes
I halved the recipe just for a small quick meal. Served with parmesan cheese on top and a bit of salt and pepper.  
Apparently you can also use a mixture of milk & water: For 1 cup cornmeal, try 400ml (1 3/4 cups) milk and 500 ml (2 1/4 cups) water.
