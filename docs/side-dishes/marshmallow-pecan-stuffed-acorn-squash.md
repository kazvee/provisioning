# Marshmallow Pecan Stuffed Acorn Squash
Serves: 2 people (1/2 squash each!)

## Ingredients
1 medium acorn squash, halved and deseeded  
1/6 cup crushed saltine crackers (about 5 crackers)  
1/8 cup chopped pecans  
1/8 cup packed brown sugar  
1.5 tablespoons butter, melted, divided in half  
1/16 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1/2 cup miniature marshmallows

## Directions
Carefully cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. (If desired, save the seeds to roast in the oven later! Or freeze the seeds to eventually accumulate enough to fill a baking sheet.) Place the squash, cut side up, on a baking sheet.

In a medium bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, pecans, brown sugar, 3/4 tablespoon of butter, and nutmeg. Spoon the mixture into the squash, and brush the edges of the squash with the remaining 3/4 tablespoon of butter.  
Cover with foil, and bake in an oven preheated to 200C / 400F for 30 â€“ 45 minutes, or until the squash is tender when you test it with a fork.  
Remove from oven, top with marshmallows, and return to the oven, uncovered, for another 5 minutes or so, until the marshmallows turn golden brown.

## My Notes
I left out the nuts, crackers, and nutmeg, and I think I used margarine instead of butter. I adjusted the ingredients so we had butter (or marg?) and brown sugar filled squash, topped with mini marshmallows and sprinkled with cinnamon. We had smaller squash so it only took 30 min in my oven. Iâ€™d make this again, but I think I prefer acorn squash with savoury stuffing. ðŸ˜‹
