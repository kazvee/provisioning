# Ginger Lime Coleslaw

## Ingredients
1 cup shredded red cabbage  
2 cups shredded green cabbage  
1 1/2 cups matchstick-cut carrots  
1/4 cup chopped green onion  
3 tablespoons lime juice  
2 tablespoons sugar  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander or parsley  
2 teaspoons vegetable oil  
1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger  
salt (to taste)  
freshly ground black pepper (to taste)  
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)  

## Directions
Prepare the cabbage, carrots, onions, and coriander, and place into a large bowl. In a small measuring jug, whisk together the lime juice, sugar, oil, ginger, and seasonings. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well. Allow to sit in the fridge for at least 10 minutes before serving.

## My Notes
Apparently this is a TGI Friday's Copycat Recipe. I've never had TGIF's slaw, so who knows.  
I skipped the red cabbage and green onion, and got about 6 cups of shredded cabbage from the giant head of sweetheart cabbage we bought. I also used the food processor to grate the carrots. I used 3 of those frozen crushed ginger cubes and doubled the ingredients for the dressing, and 2 tablespoons of Canadian maple syrup instead of sugar.  
We really liked this for work lunches! ðŸ™‚
