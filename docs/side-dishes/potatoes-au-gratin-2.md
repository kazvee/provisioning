# Simple au Gratin Potatoes

## Ingredients
1 large onion, sliced thinly  
4 large potatoes, sliced thinly  
100 ml milk  
50 g cheddar cheese  
1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)  
1 teaspoon pepper  
salt, to taste

## Directions
Layer the potatoes and onions into a greased ovenproof dish. Pour in the milk and top with the grated cheese.

Bake in an oven preheated to 200C / 400F for about 50 minutes or until the potatoes are tender

## My Notes
This recipe isn't quite as good as the [Creamy Potatoes Au Gratin](./potatoes-au-gratin-1.md) one, but itâ€™s handy for when I want something simpler to prepare.
