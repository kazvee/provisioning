# Savoury Rice-Stuffed Acorn Squash
Serves: 2 people (1/2 squash each!)
*This is not an exact recipe, I just threw some stuff together from leftovers I had in the fridge!*

## Ingredients
1 medium acorn squash, halved and deseeded  
1 cup cooked rice  
1 cup cooked chicken (or leave out if you prefer a vegetarian dish!)  
1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped  
1/2 cup onions, diced & fried  
2 tablespoons mild red chili sauce (something new we bought, it’s basically a fancy ketchup)  
1 teaspoon Chipotle seasoning (mild & smoky)  
1/2 cup grated cheese (keep some aside to sprinkle on top!)  

## Directions
Carefully cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. (If desired, save the seeds to roast in the oven later! Or freeze the seeds to eventually accumulate enough to fill a baking sheet.) Place the squash, cut side up, on a baking sheet.

In a medium bowl, combine the cooked rice, and other stuffing ingredients — making sure to keep some cheese aside to sprinkle on top near the end. Cover loosely with foil and bake in an oven preheated to 200C / 400F for 30 – 45 minutes, or until the squash is tender when you test it with a fork.  
Remove from oven, top with the rest of the cheese, and return to the oven, uncovered, for another 5 minutes or so, until the cheese is melted.

## My Notes
I made a little too much rice stuffing, so we had to eat the rest of it on the side. Tasted great though!

I’ve also spotted a different recipe where you stuff the squash with a can of maple syrup beans, onion, cranberry, orange zest, fresh rosemary, and butter. I might try a version of that next time!
