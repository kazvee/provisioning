# Creamy Potatoes Au Gratin
Serves: 4

## Ingredients
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices  
1 onion, sliced into rings  
salt and pepper to taste  
3 tablespoons butter  
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
2 cups milk  
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

## Directions
Preheat oven to 200C / 400F. grease a casserole dish and layer 1/2 of the potatoes into the bottom. Top with the onion slices, and add the remaining potatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminium foil. Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.

## My Notes
I left out the onion and salt, and added dried onion granules instead. Turned out really nice! Took 1.5 hours in my oven. (I used the black casserole dish with the lid on the whole time.)

## More Notes
On a different night, I followed the recipe as posted above except used 3 TB olive oil as I didnâ€™t have butter or margerine in the house. Oh, and I probably used more than just 1 onion â€” I just kept layering the potatoes & onions in my huge black casserole dish until I ran out of room. ðŸ˜›
