# Baked Risotto
Serves: 2 (as a side dish)

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil  
100 grams (4 ounces) arborio risotto rice  
125 to 150 ml boiling water  
1 cube of stock/bouillon powder  
**Optional:** Anything else you want to add, such as 100 grams cooked chicken, a chopped spring onion, 2 tablespoons frozen peas, 1 chopped red/green/yellow bell pepper, 4 to 5 sliced mushrooms, etc.

## Directions
Preheat the oven to 200C / 400F / Gas Mark 6. Grease the bottom of a lidded ovensafe dish with the olive oil, and pour in the rice and whatever other additons (chicken, peas, mushrooms, etc.) you want.  
Prepare the stock and pour it over the rice mixture. Stir until well-combined, cover the dish, and bake in the oven for 15 minutes or so, until the rice is tender. Remove from oven and serve.

## My Notes
I used the full 150 ml of water, a beef stock cube, and about 75 grams of frozen mushroom slices. I crumbled aged cheddar on the top but next time I’ll use a bit more cheese and stir it through the rice before serving. It took 20 minutes in my oven in a round lidded glass casserole dish. (If we wanted risotto as the main course, we’d probably need to double this recipe, except the oil for greasing the dish.)
