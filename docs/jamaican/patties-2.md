# Beef Patties 2
Makes: About 30 Patties

## Ingredients for the filling
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 onion, finely chopped  
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped  
1 pound lean ground beef  
1 tablespoon curry powder  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
1/2 cup bread crumbs  
1/2 cup chicken stock (or water)  
2 green onions, finely chopped

## Ingredients for the pastry
2 cups all-purpose flour  
1/2 teaspoons turmeric  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
2/3 shortening or butter, cold and diced  
1/4 cups ice water, or more if necessary  
1 egg, lightly beaten

## Directions for the filling
Heat oil in large heavy skillet. Add onions and garlic. Cook, stirring until onion wilts. Add ground meat. Cook, stirring until meat is browned and combined with onions. Sprinkle with curry, salt and pepper. Cook about 5 minutes. Stir in breadcrumbs and chicken stock or water. Cook, stirring often, about 20 minutes. Mixture should be thick but not dry. Stir in green onions.

## Directions for the pastry
Combine flour with turmeric and salt. Cut in butter or shortening until in tiny bites. Add water and gather into a ball. Roll out to about 1/4″ thickness and cut into 4″ circles. Gather remaining dough together and lightly cut out again. Place about 1 tablespoon meat filling on each circle. Brush edges with lightly beaten egg, fold over and seal.
Preheat oven to 200C / 400F. Place patties on cookie sheets lined with aluminium foil. Brush lightly with remaining beaten egg.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes until browned. These can be made ahead and frozen.

## Note
Larger patties can be made, containing more meat, but the baking time and temperature will have to be adjusted.
