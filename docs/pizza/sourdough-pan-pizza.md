# Sourdough Pan Pizza
Makes: 1 Pizza in my 31 cm (12 inch) cast iron frying pan  
*This recipe can be doubled!*

## Ingredients
100 grams sourdough starter (100% hydration)  
150 grams flour  
87.5 grams water  
5 grams salt  
4 grams olive oil

## Directions
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon until there are no dry spots. Cover the bowl tightly with clingfilm (or a lid) and proof at room temperature for 8 to 24 hours.  
Then, lightly flour the top of the risen dough and turn it out onto a floured work surface. Roll the dough into a ball by tucking it into itself until the surface is smooth and tight.  
Place the dough into a cast iron pan thatâ€™s been greased with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Roll the dough around a bit to coat it in oil and gently flatten it out a bit with your hand so it starts to fill the pan (it wonâ€™t fill the entire pan yet!). Cover with clingfilm and let proof again for 2 hours.  
After the 2 hours, the dough should have spread it to fill the pan. Lift the edges gently and lay the dough back down to remove any air bubbles that have accumulated on the bottom. Add your preferred pizza toppings and bake in an oven preheated to 290C / 550F for 12 â€“ 15 minutes.

## Note
If you want to use the dough later within the week, grease a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and place the dough in the bowl, rolling it around a bit to coat with the oil. Cover and refrigerate for another day. When you want to make pizza, remove the dough from the fridge and let it get to room temperature for 20 minutes or so until doing the 2nd 2-hour proof right in the pan as above.

## My Notes
The first time I made this I didnâ€™t have enough fresh starter, so had to use 40g starter and 60g discard (which I keep in the fridge). I did a 24-hour first proof and it rose just fine. I baked it at 260C / 500F for about 18 minutes.

For my second attempt, I used the required 100g of starter, which was fed the day before. It was baked at 290C / 550F for 15 minutes. I think I added too many toppings, but it was still fab! ðŸ™‚
