# White Pizza Sauce

## Ingredients
1 tablespoon butter (could use margarine)  
1 tablespoon flour  
2 cloves garlic, crushed  
2 tablespoon white wine  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1/8 teaspoon black pepper  
1/2 cup sour cream  
1/2 cup soft white cheese

## Directions
Melt butter in a pan on low heat, and add in the flour, whisking to combine. Careful not to brown the flour.  
Add in the crushed garlic, and keep whisking. Add in the wine, salt, and pepper and keep whisking. The sauce should be aromatic by now.  
Add in the sour cream, still whisking, until the sauce is smooth and small bubbles start to form. The sauce may get a bit pasty at this point.  
Add in the cheese, continuing to stir, and let it cook for another 3 minutes or so.  
Let the sauce cool a bit, and add it to your pizza dough.

## Notes
Allow any leftover sauce cool to room temperature and then refrigerate in a sealed container. Apparently this will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge, but freezing will cause the sauce to separate. Once refrigerated, the sauce will really thicken up, so you can reheat it very slightly in the microwave just to soften it up a bit and make it easier to spread onto the pizza dough.

## My Notes
I used margarine instead of butter. We really liked this! The recipe made enough for 4 of my deep dish cast iron sourdough pizza doughs.
