# Cast Iron Pan Pizza (using Instant or Active Dry Yeast)
Makes: 1 x 10-inch pizza

## Ingredients
1 1/2 cups (180 grams / 7 ounces) flour (bread flour or all-purpose)  
1/4 teaspoon yeast (can use either instant or active dry yeast)  
1/4 to 3/4 teaspoon salt  
3/4 cup (177 ml) water (cold or hot water (130F-135F / 54C-57C) , depending on how far in advance you want to make the dough, see notes below)  
1 tablespoon olive oil, to grease your cast iron pan  
1/3 cup pizza sauce  
1 cup (125 grams / 4 ounces) mozzarella, shredded  
whatever toppings you prefer

## Directions
In a medium bowl (preferably one with a tight-fitting lid), sift the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the water, mix well, cover and let stand for 3 hours.  
When the dough has finished resting, itâ€™ll be puffy, soft, full of small bubbled, and will have doubled in size. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top of the dough and stir it for a little bit until it forms a ball.  
Next, use the oil to grease the bottom and sides of a 9 or 10-inch cast iron pan.  
Place the dough into the pan and push it out to the edges of the pan. (Put a bit of oil on your fingers to do this so you donâ€™t tear the dough). Cover the pan with a plate or the lid of a pot, and let it rest again for at least 1 hour but preferably 2 hours. It will rise a bit more during this time.

When the dough is ready, preheat your oven to the highest temperature (500F to 550F / 260 C to 290C).  
Meanwhile, add your pizza sauce, toppings, and cheese.  
Cook on top of the stove, on a burner set to medium-high heat for 3 minutes.  
Then, place the pan into the oven and bake for about 12 to 15 minutes until done.

**Cold Water:**  
If you donâ€™t need the dough ready as quickly, you can use cold water instead, and let the dough rest for 12 to 18 hours, before then getting it ready into the pan.

**Tip:** 
When using sliced mushrooms, peppers, or onions, remove excess moisture by placing them between 2 paper towels, microwaving them for 1 minute, and squeezing out the extra water before using on the pizza.

## My Notes
I used cheddar cheese and 1/5 of a 400g can of pizza sauce. (I divided out the rest of the can into 1/3 cup portions and froze them in silicone muffin cups to use on later pizzas.) I used the full 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and while it didnâ€™t taste especially salty, it felt like it was a lot so next time Iâ€™ll only use 1/4 teaspoon.  
When cooking it on the hob for 3 minutes, the olive oil started splattering a bit so be careful.  
I used frozen onions, frozen mushrooms, and frozen broccoli pieces, all microwaved for 1 minute to get rid of the excess water.  
Instead of sprinkling a bit more flour on the dough after it was done resting for 3 hours, I used some semolina just because I had in the house.

My oven only goes to 250C and seems to have a safety cut-off when it gets past that temperature, so the last few times I made this, I only heated it to 240C to make sure I donâ€™t trigger the safety shut-off!

Leftovers can be reheated on an ungreased cookie tray at 180C for 8 minutes or so.

This turned out really well and Iâ€™m almost ashamed to admit how much we eat pizza now. ðŸ˜‰

I often forget to snap a photo of the pizzas we make now, but hereâ€™s a sampling:
