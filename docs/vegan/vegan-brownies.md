# Vegan Brownies

## Ingredients
2/3 cup (145 grams) vegetable oil (could also use coconut)  
180 grams vegan chocolate, finely chopped  
1/2 cup (120 ml) aquafaba (the water from an unsalted can of chickpeas)  
3/4 cup (150 grams) sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1.5 cups (150 grams) gram flour / chickpea flour, sifted to remove any lumps  
1/4 cup (22 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
1/2 cup (90 grams) vegan chocolate chips (optional)

## Directions
Prepare a 8 x 8 inch baking tin. Microwave the oil and the chopped chocolate in 30 second increments, whisking to blend every time, until completely melted, and allow to cool.  
In a separate bowl, cream the sugar and aquafaba until thick and shiny. Then blend in the melted chocolate mixture and the vanilla extract. Blend in the gram flour, baking soda, and cocoa powder to get a thick batter. Mix in your chocolate chips.  
Pour into your baking tin and bake in an oven preheated to 325F (150C) for 30 minutes, making sure to check the middle with a knife or toothpick to make sure no wet batter remains. Allow to cool in the tin before serving.

## My Notes
I used vegetable oil instead of coconut oil, and banana extract instead of vanilla. I skipped the chopped chocolate and the chocolate chips. I used 2 x round silicone baking mold pans (I think they’re about 10″ round x 2 1/4″ deep) so my brownies weren’t very tall, which is fine.My husband liked these better than the other recipe I have for butter-free brownies. These weren’t overly sweet, so next time I might add pearl sugar or cinnamon sugar to the tops before baking. I’d definitely make these again as a quick dessert after I’ve used canned chickpeas for something else.
