# No-Boil Tuna Pasta Bake
*A simple recipe I found because Iâ€™d rather stop using store-bought no-boil pasta bake sauces.*
Serves: 2

## Ingredients
125g uncooked pasta  
1 x 400g can chopped tomatoes (you could use whole peeled tomatoes, youâ€™ll just need to squish them!)  
1 tablespoon tomato paste (tomato purÃ©e â€” the thick concentrated one that comes in tubes or small jars)  
100g corn (frozen or canned)  
1 x 185g can tuna chunks (drained)  
1 clove garlic, minced  
25g parmesan, grated  
200ml milk (whole or semi-skimmed, not sure if lower fat milk would work as well)  
cheese (your preference), shredded â€” to sprinkle on top  
salt & pepper, to taste

## Directions
Preheat oven to 180C / 350F. Grease a casserole dish with a little olive oil. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the pasta, tomatoes, tomato puree, sweetcorn, tuna, garlic, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Once well mixed, pour into the dish and flatten down. Pour the milk on top, but do not mix it in. Cover and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes.
Once the pasta is nearly cooked, sprinkle the cheese on top and put it back into the oven, uncovered, for another 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and starting to turn golden. If it seems too liquidy when you take it out of the oven, let it stand for 5-10 minutes before serving.

## My Notes
I doubled the garlic because garlic is awesome, and I used bowtie pasta shapes. I didnâ€™t add the entire portion of parmesan into the mixture, I just sprinkled some on top after it was ready to serve. To cook this, I used my round lidded glass casserole dish so didnâ€™t bother greasing it ahead of time. I also mixed all the ingredients right in the casserole dish because I was at peak unwillingness to dirty a mixing bowl unnecessarily! ðŸ˜€  
I should have been more generous with the salt, and when I reheated leftovers I added in some olives to give it more of a taste. This was nice for a 'canâ€™t be bothered to cook' weekend evening, and worth making again with a few tweaks like adding some Italian herbs to the mixture, and maybe trying cooked chorizo chunks instead of tuna.  
(If doubling the recipe, try using a 9Ã—9 inch casserole dish. The cooking time guideline for a double batch would be 40-45 minutes covered and then 10 minutes uncovered with the cheese sprinkled on top.)
