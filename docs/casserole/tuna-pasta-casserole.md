# Tuna Pasta Casserole

## Ingredients
1 can (195 grams) condensed Cream of Mushroom soup  
1/2 cup milk  
1 cup frozen green peas  
2 tablespoons chopped red pepper (optional)  
2 cans (about 5 ounces each) tuna in water, drained  
4 ounces (about 2 cups) medium egg noodles, cooked and drained  
2 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs  
1 tablespoon butter, melted

## Directions
Boil the noodles until al dente, then drain and set aside. Combine with the soup, milk, frozen peas, red pepper (if using) into a 1.5 litre / 1.5 quart baking dish.  
Place in an oven preheated to 400F / 200C / 180C Fan-Assisted for 20 minutes or until hot and bubbling. In the meantime, combine the butter and breadcrumbs in a small bowl.  
After 20 minutes, stir the tuna mixture, top with the breadcrumb mixture, and return to oven for another 5 minutes until golden brown on top.

## My Notes
We used 150 grams of fusili pasta, and frozen peas and corn. We skipped the extra 5 min at the end with the breadcrumb mixture. It probably didn’t need both cans of tuna, and next time I’d season it a bit more, maybe onion powder or a pinch of celery salt.  
Good comfort food, will make again.
