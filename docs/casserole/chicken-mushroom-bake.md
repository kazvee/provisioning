# Creamy Chicken & Mushroom Bake
*Classic low-effort comfort food!*

## Ingredients
500 grams boneless chicken breasts (could also use pork)  
500 grams chestnut mushrooms, sliced  
1 x 295 gram (10.5 oz) can of condensed cream of mushroom soup  
1 clove garlic, crushed  
2/3 cup milk  
oil, for frying  
pepper, to taste

## Directions
Heat the oil and fry the chicken until browned. Add in the garlic and fry for 1 minute. Then place the chicken and garlic into an oven-safe dish. Add in the soup, mushrooms, milk, and seasoning. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F for 30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.

## My Notes
I often double this recipe. It freezes well. I usually serve it with Semmelkn√∂del alongside. If you have a stovetop casserole dish that can also go in the oven, this is a one-pot meal.
