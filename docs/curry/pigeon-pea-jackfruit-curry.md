# Pigeon Pea (Gungo Peas) & Jackfruit Curry
*This recipe is inspired by a recipe for Kidney Bean and Pineapple curry, but I didn’t have either of those ingredients in the house!* 😅 *Apparently another combination that works well is Chickpeas and Peaches.*

##  Ingredients
1 large onion, finely chopped (could use 140g / 5oz frozen diced onion)  
1 tablespoon vegetable oil  
1 – 2 tablespoons garlic and ginger paste  
2 tablespoon medium curry powder  
1 x 585 gram can of Jackfruit in syrup, drained and sliced into large pieces (You could also use 1 x 432g can of pineapple chunks in juice)  
1 x 400 gram can of Pigeon Peas / Gungo Peas, rinsed and drained. (You could also use 1 x 400 gram can of kidney beans, rinsed and drained)  
2 x 400 gram cans of chopped tomatoes (could also use peeled whole and cut them up a bit)  
salt, to taste  
pepper, to taste

## Directions
Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onion until softened. Add the garlic and ginger and stir in well. Add the curry powder and mix well. Add in the drained jackfruit, pigeon peas, and tomatoes. Stir well, and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. If the sauce dries up you can add a bit of water to get it to your preferred consistency.

## My Notes
The jackfruit doesn’t really break up in the sauce, so make sure you get it into the size pieces you want before adding it in. I kept the jackfruit syrup aside in case I wanted to add it in later, but I didn’t need it. I don’t think this would work with jackfruit in brine, because that’s made with raw green jackfruit I think, but I’ve never tried. 🤷‍♀️  

Instead of a garlic and ginger paste, I used powdered garlic and grated a bit of fresh ginger because I keep it in peeled chunks in the freezer.  I don’t usually use Medium Curry Powder, because Mild is already usually too spicy. However for this recipe I did use a few teaspoons of my fabulous [Banana Curry Powder](https://href.li/?https://www.spicys.de/gewuerze-online-kaufen/bananen-curry/) bought from Spicy’s Spice Museum (Spicy’s Gewürzmuseum) in Hamburg. 😍
