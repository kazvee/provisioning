# Adzuki Bean Curry
Serves: 4 – 6

## Ingredients
200g adzuki beans (1 x 410g can which is about 235g drained, or you can use dried if you plan to soak & cook them beforehand)  
2 tablespoons brown sugar  
2 tablespoons olive or sunflower oil  
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds  
3cm cinnamon stick (or cassia bark)  
1 dried chilli  
1 garlic clove, roughly sliced  
1 teaspoon garlic, finely chopped  
2 teaspoon peeled, finely grated root ginger  
2 hot green chillies, finely sliced  
2 teaspoon ground coriander  
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  
1/2 teaspoon turmeric  
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste  
1 teaspoon garam masala  
60 grams onion, finely chopped  
125g tomato passata  
15g coriander leaves, chopped  
6 tablespoons fresh coconut (or frozen grated coconut, defrosted)  
3 tablespoons lemon juice

## Directions
**If using dried beans:** Rinse them well and soak them overnight in 1.5 litres (2 3/4 pints) of water in a pan about 20cm (8in) in diameter.  
The next day, set the pan over a high heat, add the sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover partially and cook for an hour and a half, or until the beans are very soft and broken up. Pour into a large bowl and set aside.  
If using canned aduki beans: Drain and rinse and set aside.

In a large pan on medium heat, pour in the oil and check if it’s hot enough by adding a few mustard seeds: If they sizzle and pop right away, we’re ready to go.  
Throw in the cinnamon stick and the dried chilli. Allow to darken all over for about 20 seconds.  
Then add the remaining mustard seeds in and let them pop and sizzle for a few seconds.  
Add the sliced garlic, stir, and then add in the ginger, green chillies, ground coriander, cumin, garam masala, and salt and cook for about 1 – 2 minutes.  
Add in the onion and the finely chopped garlic, turn the heat down to low, and fry for about 2 minutes until the onions have softened.  
Pour in the passata and cook, stirring frequently, for another 3 minutes or so.  
Add the beans to the mixture (along with their cooking liquid), bring up to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 10 – 15 minutes or so. Add water if needed to thin the sauce.  
Before serving, add in the chopped coriander, coconut, and lemon juice. Stir once and then serve.

## My Notes
I used canned beans and instead of the liquid from the can I used 500 ml of vegetable stock (from a cube). I skipped the dried chilli and green chillies as we didn’t have any in the house. Instead of the passata I used the blender on a can of peeled tomatoes and their juice, and then ended up using the entire 400g can of it to make plenty of gravy.  
I also added some cumin seeds when sizzling the mustard seeds, I’m not sure why. I used frozen coconut (thawed) and about 2 tablespoons of dried coconut. Instead of brown sugar I used maple syrup but could probably leave this out next time.

This made about 6 portions. We froze some of it.
