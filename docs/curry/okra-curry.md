# Okra Curry with Chickpeas and Tomatoes
Serves: 4 as a main course or 6 side dishes

## Ingredients
1 1/4 lb small fresh okra, left untrimmed, or 2 (10-oz) packages frozen whole okra (not thawed)  
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 medium onion, chopped  
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped  
4 teaspoons fresh ginger, peeled and chipped finely  
2 teaspoons curry powder  
1 can (14 â€“ 15 ounces) whole tomatoes in juice (tomatoes chopped, reserve the juice)  
1 can (19 ounces / 2 cups) chickpeas, drained and rinsed  
2/3 cup water  
3/4 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Directions
If using fresh okra: Trim it, leaving the tops intact. Be careful not to cut into the pods.  
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat, and sautÃ© the onion, garlic, ginger, and curry powder for about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato juice, chickpeas, and the water. Bring to a gentle boil for about 2 minutes. Add in the okra, salt, and pepper. Simmer uncovered until the okra is tender (about 10 minutes).

## My Notes
We had a can of okra that needed to be used up, so I drained and rinsed that for this recipe. I only left it simmering long enough to heat it through so it didnâ€™t get mushy. I also added a teaspoon of powdered fenugreek since it seemed to be missing something. I also added about 2/3 of a can of drained sweetcorn since we had it leftover in the fridge.

The amount of curry powder used is a bit too much for the strength that I have in my spice rack â€” my own fault for not adding it a bit at a time and tasting it as I go. I know Iâ€™m a wimp about hot spicy food and yet I never learnâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰  
Iâ€™d try this recipe again using fresh okra. Canned okra was not the best choice to use, but in a pinch itâ€™s ok.
