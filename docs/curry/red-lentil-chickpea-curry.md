# Red Lentil & Chickpea Curry
Makes: 6 portions
Freezes well

## Ingredients
1 onion, diced  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1 cup dry red lentils, rinsed well  
1 x 400g (15 oz) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed  
480ml (2 cups) vegetable (or chicken) broth  
1 tablespoon curry powder  
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, if you want some extra spiciness)  
1 x 400 ml (13.5 oz) can coconut milk

## Directions
In a large pot, saut√©e the onions until golden, adding the garlic for the last 1-2 min of frying. Then add in the lentils, chickpeas, spices and broth. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add in the coconut milk and simmer for another 10 minutes or until the lentils are tender to your liking. Season to taste.

## My Notes
I doubled the garlic, and used 1/8 teaspoon of Kashmiri chili powder instead of cayenne. I also added in some stuff I had in the house:  
500 grams carrots, chopped  
1.5 bell peppers (red/yellow/orange), chopped  
125 grams chestnut mushrooms, quartered  
1 cup caramelised onions that I had in the freezer

**Ideas for next time:** 1 cup of frozen peas could also be added for the final 10 minutes of simmer time.
