# Red Lentil Coconut Curry

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil (or coconut oil, or ghee)  
1 large onion, chopped  
2 cups carrots, diced  
4 cloves garlic, finely minced  
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated or finely chopped  
2 – 5 tablespoons Thai red curry paste (to taste)  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
16 ounces dried red lentils  
2 cups vegetable (or chicken) broth  
1 x 400 gram (15oz) can crushed tomatoes  
1 x 400 ml (14oz) can coconut milk (unsweetened)

## Directions
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium head and sautée until the onions have softened. Then add the garlic, ginger, curry paste, cumin, and salt and cook for 1-2 minutes longer. Add in the carrots and cook for another few minutes.  
Add in the dried red lentils, broth, tomatoes, and coconut milk. Stir well to combine. Simmer on Medium Low for 20 minutes or so, stirring every few minutes. Season to taste and serve.

## My Notes
You can add more stock if you want a thinner stew. If you find it too thin, you can thicken it up with a paste made of a few tablespoons of chickpea flour and water. We used half a very small jar of Thai red curry paste. Lovely meal, froze well, definitely worth making again.
