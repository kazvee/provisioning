# Slow Cooker Chicken Coconut Curry with Basil
Serves: 8

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
2 pounds (900 grams) skinless chicken thighs
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra as needed
2 x  13.5 oz (383 ml) cans coconut milk
6 ‚Äì 8 cloves garlic, minced
2 jalape√±os, ribs and seeds removed, finely chopped
1 red onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh coriander/cilantro, chopped
2 tablespoons dried basil
1 1/2 tablespoons yellow curry powder (or less, to taste)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 cup fresh Thai basil, chopped, garnish
salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions
In large pan on medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Season the chicken to taste and then sear meat on all sides. You may need to do this in batches.  
Combine the coconut milk, dried basil, curry powder, chili powder, and salt and pepper to the slow cooker insert, and mix well.  
Add the seared chicken to the slowcooker, followed by the red onions, jalape√±os and garlic. Mix well.  
Cover slow cooker and cook on high for 3-4 hours, or on low for 6-8, until chicken is cooked through.  

Once cooked through, use two forks to shred into small pieces. In a small mixing measuring glass, combine the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water and stir until smooth. Pour this liquid, along with the fresh ginger, into the slow cooker. Return the shredded chicken to the cooker, and stir. Cover and cook for another 10 to 15 min until the sauce has thickened.  
To serve, stir in the fresh basil and coriander, seasoning to taste.

## My Notes
I only used 3 teaspoons of curry powder since ours is sort of strong. I bought yellow onions instead of red, so I fried it until golden after I had done searing the chicken. I skipped the jalape√±os and chili powder, but used a 1/4 cube of frozen red chili pur√©e that I had in the house instead. The cornstarch didn‚Äôt thicken the gravy enough for our preference so next time we may add it a little earlier before eating. I didn‚Äôt shred the meat as I‚Äôd bought chicken thigh pieces anyway. Cooked this for 6 hours on low. Will make again!
