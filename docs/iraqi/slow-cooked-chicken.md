# Iraqi Slow Cooked Chicken

## Ingredients
1 large onion, diced  
1.5 lbs (7 – 8 drumsticks) chicken drumsticks  
4 medium tomatoes, diced  
2 tablespoons tomato paste  
2 tablespoons baharat spice  
1 teaspoon hot paprika (optional)  
3 cloves garlic  
1.5 teaspoon sea salt  
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

## Directions
Add the onions to the bottom of the slow cooker. Rub the spices over the chicken and place the meat on top of the onions. Pour the tomatoes over the top, cover, and cook on low for 6 – 8 hours.

## My Notes
We deboned the chicken afterwards, this was a quick and easy recipe.
