# Olivier Salad / Olivye Salad / Russian Potato Salad
*This can be made ahead of time, just follow the steps but do not add the mayonnaise. Instead, store covered in the fridge and just add the mayo a few hours before serving time.*

## Ingredients
3 small/medium waxy potatoes (not starchy ones, as they will fall apart too much!)  
4 medium carrots  
8 eggs  
450 grams (1 lb) bologna, ham, or other cooked meat  
8 small pickles  
1 – 2 small cucumbers  
425 grams (15 oz) peas (canned or preferably fresh frozen peas)  
1 – 1.5 cups mayonnaise  
1 small onion (optional, could use chives or green onions/spring onions instead)

## Directions
Bring water to the boil in a medium pot and cook the potatoes and carrots, whole, until just tender with some bite left. Be careful not to overcook! In another pot, hardboil the eggs. When all these are done, peel them allow to cool.  
Drain the peas and pickles very well. Dice the potatoes, carrots, eggs, pickles, cucumber, and meat into small 1/4 inch cubes. Mince the onion (if using) finely.  
Mix all the ingredients together, with the mayonnaise, in a large bowl.

## My Notes
We usually skip the meat and the hardboiled eggs. I’ve also tried adding some celery as well as finely diced tomatoes before, and it worked out well. We enjoy this for work lunches.
