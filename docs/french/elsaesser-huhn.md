# Elsässer Huhn - Alsace Chicken
*Fond memories of eating this at Tante Anna's house!*

## Ingredients
1 kg chicken  
1 clove garlic  
60 g bacon  
4 tablespoons oil  
2 medium onions  
100 g canned mushrooms  
2 bay leaves  
2 tablespoons parsley  
2 tablespoons chives, finely chopped  
1 tablespoon cornstarch (mondamin)  
125 ml white wine  
125 ml 30% cream (UK: try double cream)  
3 tablespoons clear kirsch water (or can substitute cognac instead)    
salt, to taste  
pepper, to taste

## Directions
Dice the onions, and set aside. Cut the chicken into smaller chunks. Slice the garlic clove in half and rub the cut side over the chicken. In a large pan, heat the oil and fry the chicken until browned. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside for now.  
Fry the onions and garlic in the pan. Return the chicken pieces, add the white wine and simmer gently for 20 minutes.

In the meantime, drain (reserving the liquid from the can for later!), rinse, and slice the canned mushrooms.  
Add the mushrooms, parsley, and chives to the pot with the chicken. Cover and simmer on low for another 10 minutes.

Combine the cornstarch with a bit of water to make a smooth paste with no lumps, then slowly add it to the sauce and simmer until thickened.

Garnish the chicken with a drizzle of kirsch/cognac, and serve with noodles/potatoes/rice, etc.
