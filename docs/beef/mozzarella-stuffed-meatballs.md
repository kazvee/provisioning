# Mozzarella Stuffed Meatballs
Makes: 30 meatballs

## Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds minced beef  
1/3 cup breadcrumbs  
1 egg  
1/4 teaspoon black pepper  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)  
2 tablespoons water (if needed)

## Directions
Slice the cheese into cubes and place them in the freezer for at least 1 hour.  
In a large bowl, combine the beef and bread crumbs. In a smaller bowl or measuring jug, whisk the egg and then add the garlic powder, oregano, pepper, and salt. Pour the egg mixture over the meat and breadcrumbs and mix well. Add up to 2 tablespoons of water, if needed, to get a smooth mixture that can easily be formed into meatballs. (You could also just add the egg and spices directly to the bowl with the meat but when I do this I always get clumps of dry spices.)  
Take about 2 tablespoons of the meat mixture and form it into a meatball. Press a frozen cheese cube into the middle and seal the meat around it. Repeat for the rest of the meat and cheese.  
Place meatballs on a baking sheet and cook in an oven preheated to 190C / 375F for 10 minutes or until the meat is no longer pink in the middle. Be careful not to overcook them or the cheese will spill out.

## My Notes
Predictably, I overcooked these and the cheese spilled out. ðŸ™„ No big deal. ðŸ˜‰
