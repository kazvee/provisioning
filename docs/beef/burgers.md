# Burgers
*(Not so much a recipe as a reminder to myself!)*

## Ingredients
2 pieces bread, cut into 1/4-inch pieces  
1/3 cup milk  
2.5 teaspoons kosher salt  
1 teaspoon black pepper  
3 garlic cloves, minced  
1.5 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  
2 tablespoons ketchup  
3 pounds ground beef (recommended 85% lean)  
3 scallions or onions, finely diced (optional)

## Directions
Make a panade with the bread and milk: Combine both, smush with a fork and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes or so to get a chunky paste.
Add the other seasonings except for meat and onions, and mix well. Finally, add in the onions and meat, and mix until consistent. Form into 8 patties, and cook.

## My Notes
Last time I made this I used 2 slices of bread and 1/4 cup milk, and used a blend of 1/2 lb pork and 1/2 lb beef. I added onions and mushrooms, diced finely, plus seasonings that I didnâ€™t keep track of. I got 10 small burger patties from this as we prefer small portions. Could also make this into meatballs.
