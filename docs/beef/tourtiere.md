# Tourtière – Meat Pie

## Ingredients
1 lb ground veal  
1 lb ground pork  
1/2 cup chopped onion  
1/4 cup water  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon pepper  
1 recipe pastry, or 1 pre-prepared pastry shell with top

## Directions
Preheat oven to 220C / 425F. Prepare pastry, reserve 1/2 the pastry for top crust and line a 9-inch pie plate with remainder. Combine all ingredients together in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until meat has lost its pink colour but is still moist, remove and allow to cool.  
Roll out top crust, make slits in centre to allow steam to escape. Pour meat mixture into pie shell, cover with top crust, seal and
flute edges. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until browned. Baked tourtière may be frozen and reheated before serving.
