# Chili con Carne

## Ingredients
500g lean minced beef (10% or less fat)  
2 medium onions, chopped  
3 garlic cloves, peeled and ﬁnely chopped  
1 – 2 teaspoons hot chili powder (or to taste)  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
2 teaspoons ground coriander  
2 tablespoons plain ﬂour  
150 ml red wine or extra stock  
300 ml beef stock (made with 1 beef stock cube)  
400 g can of chopped tomatoes  
400 g can of red kidney beans, drained and rinsed  
3 tablespoons tomato purée  
1 teaspoon caster sugar  
1 teaspoon dried oregano  
1 bay leaf  
ﬂaked sea salt, to taste  
freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Directions
In a large saucepan on medium heat, fry the meat and  onions for 5 minutes or so. Add in the garlic, chili powder (to taste), cumin, and coriander. Fry for another couple of minutes. Then sprinkle in the flour and stir well to combine.  
Pour in the stock and wine (if using), stirring well. Then add the tomatoes and kidney beans and stir again. Add tomato pureé, sugar, oregano, and the bay leaf. Salt and pepper to taste.  
Bring to a simmer, then lower heat and cover loosely with a lid. Gently simmer for 45 minutes, stirring every so often. Meat should be tender and the sauce should thicken. Season to taste and serve.

## My Notes
I used chicken mince, and also added mushrooms. Only used 1/2 teaspoon of Kashmiri chili powder. This made 10 portions. We froze the extra. Worth making again!
