# Ground Beef Stroganoff
(Hamburger Helper Copycat)  
Serves: 4 â€“ 6

## Ingredients
450 grams (1 lb) beef mince, browned  
225 grams (1/2 lb) egg noodles, cooked  
2 1/4 tablespoons real butter  
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules and 1 1/2 cups boiling water (OR 1 1/2 cups of your own beef broth)  
4 1/2 tablespoons sour cream  
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

## Directions
In a large frying pan, brown the beef mince, drain (if needed), set aside and keep warm. In the meantime, bring water to the boil in a medium saucepan, and cook the noodles. When the noodles are al dente, drain, set aside, and keep warm.  
In a separate cup, prepare the beef broth.  
In the saucepan used for the noodles, gently melt the butter on low heat, and add in the flour. Whisk well to make a smooth base, pour in the beef broth, and let this simmer for a few minutes.  
When youâ€™re happy with the consistency of the sauce, remove it from heat. Stir in sour cream and mustard, and return the cooked beef and noodles to the saucepan on gentle heat. Stir well to coat with gravy, season to taste, and serve.

## My Notes
I halved the recipe since it was just for the 2 of us and I wasnâ€™t sure how well this would do as leftovers. I didnâ€™t have egg noodles so used small bowtie pasta. I used a beef bouillon cube to make the broth. Iâ€™m not a fan of mustard so only used about 1 teaspoon of it. Instead of sour cream I used single cream that I had in the house. I also added a liberal amount of onion powder. Next time Iâ€™d fry some onions and garlic with the meat but then you defeat the purpose of a quick and easy meal.  
This definitely hit the mark for some comfort food on a Friday evening. ðŸ™‚
