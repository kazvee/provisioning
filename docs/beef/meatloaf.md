# Meatloaf

## Ingredients for the Meatloaf
450 g (1 lb) lean beef mince  
2 eggs, beaten  
1/2 cup ketchup  
1/2 cup milk  
1 cup Italian Style Bread Crumbs  
1/4 cup finely chopped onion

## Ingredients for the Topping
1/4 cup ketchup

## Directions
In a large bowl, combine all meatloaf ingredients. Press the mixture into an ungreased 8 x 4 inch loaf pan. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F for 40 minutes.  
Remove meatloaf from oven. Spread 1/4 cup ketchup evenly over the top. Return the oven and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into the centre reads 72C / 160F and the meat is thoroughly cooked. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

## My Notes
I prepared this ahead of time and put the raw meatloaf (wrapped well) in the freezer. Weâ€™ll defrost it overnight and then cook for a quick and easy weeknight meal.
