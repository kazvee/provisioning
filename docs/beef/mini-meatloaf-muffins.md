# Mini Meatloaf Muffins

## Ingredients
454g (1 lb) beef mince (could use turkey or pork, or a mix)  
1/3 cup breadcrumbs (could use oatmeal)  
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese  
1 egg, whisked  
1/2 cup ketchup, divided (1/4 cup for the mixture and 1/4 cup for the topping. You could use an 8oz can of tomato sauce.)  
1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional, if you like this in the topping!)  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (in a pinch, could use Soy sauce)  
1 cup (approx) vegetables, chopped small

## Directions
In a small bowl, mix 1/4 cup ketchup (or tomato sauce) and the brown sugar (if using), and set aside for the moment.  
In a large bowl, combine all other ingredients and mix until evenly combined.  
Press the meat into your muffin tin, and top with a spoonful of the topping. You should get 8 to 10 mini-loaves, depending on the size of your muffin tin.  
Cook in an preheated to 180C / 350F for 30 to 35 minutes, until the meatloaves reach an internal temperature of 70C / 160F.

## My Notes
I used 1 lb of beef/pork mixture and made 12 mini-loaves because I wanted them smaller. I used Soy sauce since I donâ€™t have Worcestershire in the house. For the veggies, I just microwaved some frozen veg for a minute or so, and let it cool before adding it into the meat.  
These took 35 min in my oven for the internal temperature to be right.
