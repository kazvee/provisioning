## Udon in Peanut Garlic Sauce
*The sauce can be made a day ahead, covered, and kept in the fridge.*

## Ingredients
1/4 cup peanut butter (creamy or chunky, as you prefer)  
1/4 cup soy sauce  
1/4 unseasoned rice vinegar (could use Apple Cider Vinegar)  
1 tablespoon honey (could use maple syrup)  
1 garlic clove, finely grated  
1/4 cup vegetable oil  
salt, to taste  
2 x 200g (2 x 7oz) packs of dried udon noodles  
vegetables and/or meat, as you prefer

## Directions
In a small bowl, whisk the peanut butter, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, and garlic until smooth. Gradually pour in the add vegetable oil, whisking constantly, until emulsified. Set aside.  
Cook and drain the noodles as per their package instructions.  
In a large bowl, combine the noodles and any other vegetables or cooked meat you’re adding. Pour over 3/4 of the peanut sauce. and mix. Drizzle over the remaining 1/4 of the sauce, and serve.

## My Notes
I added in cooked chicken, mushrooms, and onions, with fresh spring onions tossed on top. I used chunky peanut butter, apple cider vinegar, and maple syrup. I made the sauce the day before, in a small jar so I could shake it to emulsify the oil. It had not separated the next day, but I shook the jar up again before pouring it over the noodles just to be sure it was still well-combined. I was worried the sauce would taste oily, but it was great and pretty light tasting. I’ve seen other recipes that use chicken broth instead of oil, so I may try that next time since I just use dried cubes to make my broths anyway.
