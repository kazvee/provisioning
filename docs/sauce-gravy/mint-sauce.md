# Mint Sauce

## Ingredients
Bunch of mint (approx. 10 sprigs)  
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar  
1 teaspoon sugar  
5 tablespoons hot water

## Directions
Remove the mint leaves from the stalks and chop finely. Place into a small bowl or jug. Add the sugar, hot water, and vinegar. Stir well, adjusting as needed to suit your taste.

## My Notes
I've used my Moroccan Mint and Apple Mint plants for this. I only use about half the water since we like a thicker sauce. I make this sauce while I'm getting lamb seared for the slow cooker, and keep it in a sealed bowl in the fridge until dinnertime.
