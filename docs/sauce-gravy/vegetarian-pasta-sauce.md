# Slow Cooked Vegetarian Pasta Sauce
*A combination of a few recipes I‚Äôve seen. This filled my entire 6.5 litre Slow Cooker.*

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1 kg carrots (entire bag), diced  
500g celery (entire bunch), diced  
1kg onions (entire bag), diced  
1 aubergine, diced  
1 courgette (*depending on size. I used 4 x because they were very small and ended up with the same amount as the aubergine), diced  
400g mushrooms (I got Chestnut, one whole pack), chopped  
3 x bell peppers (I used red, yellow, orange ‚Äì but you can use green, too)  
400g can of spinach (drained using a metal sieve)  
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes (and their juices)  
2 tablespoons tomato paste  
Passata ‚Äì entire jar (I think it was about 700grams?)  
1 tablespoon dried parsley  
1 tablespoon dried oregano  
1 tablespoon dried basil  
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary (very finely minced if using fresh)  
1/2 teaspoon fennel seed

## Directions
Saut√©e all the vegetables until softened. (You may need to do this in batches.) Place all vegetables into the slowcooker, add the rest of the ingredients, and set on Low for 8 hours.
When done, you can blend with a stick blender if desired.

## My Notes
I probably didn‚Äôt need to saut√©e anything more than the onions in advance, so next time I‚Äôll be lazier about it.
For a 'throw it all in and see what happens' recipe, I was pretty impressed with how it turned out. I don‚Äôt plan to buy cans/jars of spag sauce anymore.
I left the lid off the slowcooker while this was cooling, which might have thickened it up a bit.

**Next time, I‚Äôll also try adding some of the below that I‚Äôve seen in other recipes:**  
garlic (finely minced or crushed)  
1/4 teaspoon marjoram  
2 bay leaves  
1/2 teaspoon onion powder  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/8 teaspoon chili powder  
1/8 teaspoon red chili flakes  
1 beef bouillon cube, crushed  
dried shiitake mushrooms, maybe a handful?  
1 teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce (or Maggi seasoning)
