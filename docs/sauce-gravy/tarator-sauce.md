# Tarator Sauce

To serve with [Falafel](/docs/vegetarian/baked-falafel.md)

## Ingredients
1/4 cup tahini  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
2 cloves garlic  
2 teaspoons dill, finely chopped  
1 teaspoon parsley, finely chopped  
cayenne pepper â€“ a pinch, or to taste  
1/3 cup water

## Directions
In a food processor or blender, combine tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt together. Pulse, gradually adding up to 1/3 cup of water until you have a smooth sauce. Remove from blender and place into a small bowl. Stir in the chopped dill and parsley. Serve alongside your [falafel](/docs/vegetarian/baked-falafel.md).  
You can make this sauce up to a week ahead of time, stored in an airtight container in the fridge.

## My Notes
I doubled the amount of garlic and had to use dried herbs as I had none fresh in the house. ðŸ™‚
