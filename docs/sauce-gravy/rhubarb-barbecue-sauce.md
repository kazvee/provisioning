# Rhubarb Barbecue Sauce

## Ingredients
2 cups chopped rhubarb (this will be about 2 â€“ 3 large stalks)  
1 tablespoon oil (for sautÃ©eing)  
3/4 cup water  
1 onion, finely chopped  
2 â€“ 3 garlic cloves, crushed  
1 cup ketchup  
1/2 cup pure maple or golden syrup  
1/2 cup packed brown sugar  
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (or rice vinegar)  
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  
1 tablespoon grainy mustard

## Directions
Place the rhubarb into a medium saucepan, pour in the water and bring it to a simmer for about 5 minutes or so, until itâ€™s very soft. Then, pour everything (including the water) into a heat-safe bowl and set aside for now.  
Pour a bit of oil into your now-empty saucepan, and sautÃ© the onions on medium-high until softened, about 5 minute or so. Add in the garlic and fry for another couple of minutes. Pour in the rest of the ingredients, including the rhubarb and cooking water, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes until the mixture has thickened.  
Remove from heat, allow to cool enough so you can pour it into the blender and mix until smooth.

## My Notes
I doubled the recipe, used marmalade instead of maple/golden syrup because itâ€™s what I had in the house. I used Maggi seasoning instead of Worcestershire sauce, only because itâ€™s what I have in the house. I guess I could also have used Soy sauce instead. I also only used 1 cup of ketchup despite doubling everything else because Iâ€™ve run out of ketchup.

This turned out nice and mild, better than the BBQ sauces I seem to find in the UK.  
Instead of ketchup next time I might use some peeled canned tomatoes (drained).

Iâ€™ve frozen the extra into silicone cupcake baking moulds which hold about 1/3 cup each, because this is just the right amount to use as a base sauce on my homemade pizzas. ðŸ™‚
