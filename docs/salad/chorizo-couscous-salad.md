# Spicy Chorizo Couscous Salad
Serves: 2

## Ingredients
250g / 9oz couscous  
300ml / 1/2 pint hot vegetable stock  
150g / 5 1/2 oz chorizo, chopped  
1 yellow pepper, chopped  
1 purple pepper, chopped (substitute red pepper if unavailable)  
1 garlic clove, chopped  
1 tomato, chopped  
handful each parsley, basil, mint, chopped  
handful olives, chopped  
1/2 lemon, juice only  
2 tbsp olive oil  
salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions
Place the couscous into a large bowl. Pour over the hot vegetable stock (enough to cover the couscous), cover with cling film and leave for four minutes.
Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the chorizo, peppers and garlic. Fry for three minutes.  
Add the tomato, herbs, olives, lemon juice, olive oil and salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for 1-2 minutes. Place the chorizo mixture and the couscous into a bowl and mix together.  
To serve, transfer the chorizo and couscous into a serving bowl.

## My Notes
I completely disregarded most of this recipe when I made it! Prepare the couscous using chicken stock (or beef, which we liked better). Then add raw spring onion, chorizo lunch meat, the chopped pepper, some olives, olive oil, lemon juice, and sliced tomato. Great for work lunches! ðŸ™‚
