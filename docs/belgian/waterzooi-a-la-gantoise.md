# Waterzooi à la Gantoise
Serves: 4 – 6

## Ingredients
11 ounces celery root, peeled  
11 ounces carrots, peeled  
11 ounces trimmed leeks  
12 new potatoes, peeled  
2 cups chicken stock  
3/4 cup lemon juice  
Salt and pepper  
3/4 cup of 35 percent cream  
4 large boneless chicken breasts, each cut into three long strips  
Chopped fresh parsley

## Directions
Slice the celery root, carrots and leeks separately into fine juliennes, then blanch each. (To blanch: immerse in boiling salted water for a few minutes until al dente in texture, plunge the vegetables in ice water to stop the cooking, then drain.) Combine vegetables. Boil the potatoes until cooked through; drain and set aside with the julienned vegetables.

Pour the chicken stock into a saucepan along with the lemon juice. Season with salt and quite a bit of pepper to “lift” the sauce. Bring to a boil, then add the cream. Add the chicken strips into the sauce, and simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes or until cooked through. Add the cooked potatoes and vegetable strips, and simmer for a further 3 to 4 minutes. Serve in shallow soup bowls, sprinkled with parsley.
