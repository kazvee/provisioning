# Massaman Chicken Curry
Serves: 2 â€“ 3

# Ingredients
50 grams Matsaman Curry Paste  
2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
400 ml coconut milk  
250 grams chicken (or beef)  
4 tablespoons palm sugar  
6 tablespoons tamarind paste, fish sauce or seasoning as preferred  
onions  
potatoes, cubed  
roast peanuts

# Directions
Heat the oil in a large pan, add the paste and stir on gentle heat for 1 minute. Pour in the coconut milk and stir well over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the meat, and stir until cooked. Then add the palm sugar, and the tamarind paste, fish sauce or seasoning as preferred. Add the onions, potatoes, and peanuts and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes. Serve with steamed rice or noodles.

## My Notes
This turned out closer to the dish I was trying to recreate! ðŸ™‚ The printed recipe on the tub I bought called for 600ml coconut milk, though.. so my result had more sauce than usual which was fine by me! I used chicken cooked the day before and 1 kg of potatoes, which I parboiled before adding. In place of palm sugar I used brown sugar and for the '6 tablespoons of tamarind/fish sauce' called for, I used 3 tablespoons lime juice and 3 tablespoons fish sauce. I forgot to roast the peanuts beforehand, but added a good handful of unsalted peanuts at the last minute.  
This recipe doubled well, and I have a lot more paste left over, so Iâ€™ll definitely be cooking more of this soon. ðŸ˜€
