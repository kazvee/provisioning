# Massaman Chicken Curry 2
Serves: 3 ‚Äì 4

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1/2 to 1 pound chicken pieces (or chopped chicken breast/thigh)  
1-2 medium potatoes, cut into chunks  
14 oz (400 ml) can coconut milk  
1 small red pepper, thinly sliced  
1 medium tomato, sliced  
2 tablespoons coconut or vegetable oil  
1/3 cup onion, sliced  
1 thumb-piece ginger, grated  
4-5 cloves garlic  
1 red chili, sliced (or 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoons chili flakes/cayenne pepper)  
1/2 cup chicken stock  
1 stalk lemongrass, minced (or 2-3 tablespoons frozen/bottled prepared lemongrass)  
3 bay leaves  
1 teaspoon turmeric  
1/4 cup chopped unsalted dry-roasted cashews (and a handful more to finish. Can also use peanuts.)  
1 teaspoon ground coriander  
1 teaspoon whole cumin seed  
1/2 teaspoon white pepper  
1/8 teaspoon cardamom  
1 teaspoon tamarind (or 1 tablespoon lime juice)  
3/4 teaspoons shrimp paste (in a jar)  
2 tablespoons fish sauce  
1 tablespoons palm sugar (or brown sugar)

## Directions
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion, ginger, garlic, and chili. Stir-fry 1-2 minutes.  
Add the stock and the lemongrass, bay leaves, turmeric, chopped cashews, ground coriander, whole cumin seed, white pepper, cardamom, tamarind (or lime juice), shrimp paste, fish sauce, and sugar, stirring well after each addition. Bring to a gentle boil, then add the chicken, stirring to coat. Add coconut milk and potatoes, stir again and bring back up to a boil. Then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 ‚Äì 40 minutes, until chicken and potatoes are tender. Add red pepper and tomato during the final 10 ‚Äì 15 minutes of cooking time. Season to taste, add the handful of cashews, and serve.

## My Notes
I was trying to recreate a dish from my favourite restaurant, but this recipe turned out nothing like it. So I need to visit the restaurant way more often so I can reverse-engineer their Massaman Curry. üòâ My recipe, though, still turned out absolutely lovely and I‚Äôll definitely be making it again! I followed the recipe and then instead of simmering the 30 to 40 minutes, after the final boil in the directions I transferred it all to my slow cooker and left that on high until the potatoes were cooked. (Maybe 3-4 hours, I forget.)
