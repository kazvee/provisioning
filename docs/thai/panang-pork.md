# Slow Cooker Panang Pork Curry

üç≤ Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1 kg boneless pork (I used pork sirloin chops)  
1 onion, chopped  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
2 ‚Äì 4 tablespoons Panang Curry Paste (I used 2 tb of Mae Ploy brand, because I like milder, and it was juuuuust on the limit of being almost too spicy for me! üòè)  
3/4 cup (4.5 oz) dried chickpeas (soaked overnight, ahead of time)  
1 cup vegetable stock (I used chicken stock, as it‚Äôs all I had in the house)  
1 tablespoon soy sauce  
1 tablespoon fish sauce  
1 tablespoon brown sugar (I used maple syrup)  
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated  
400 ml (1 can) coconut milk  
1 cup vegetables of your choice, chopped (could use frozen ‚Äì I used mixed bell pepper slices)

## Directions
In a large frying pan on the hob, sear the meat until browned. (If using chicken, you can skip this step if you wish.)  
Add in the onions and saut√© until golden. Add in the garlic and ginger and fry for another minute, until fragrant. Add in the curry paste, fry for another minute or two, and remove from heat.  
Put the contents of the frying pan into the slow cooker. Add in the presoaked chickpeas, stock, soy sauce, fish sauce, and brown sugar.  
Slow cook on High for 3 hours, or until the chickpeas are cooked to your preferred tenderness. If you want, you can pull apart the meat at this stage.  
Add in the vegetables and coconut milk and cook for another hour. If you like a thicker sauce, you can prop the lid of the slowcooker open for this final hour.

## My Notes
I used double the amount of garlic because hi have we met. Good thing I only used 2 tb of curry paste, any more would have been too spicy for me. üôÑ This made 10 portions, and it freezes well. On later batches, I used about 1.5kg of chicken, and presoaked 1 cup dried chickpeas overnight.
