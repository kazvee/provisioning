# Moussaka

## Ingredients
1 onion, chopped  
450g (1lb) minced lamb or beef  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/2 teaspoon onion powder  
1/2 teaspoon mint  
1/2 teaspoon oregano  
1/4 teaspoon black pepper  
1 bay leaf  
dash of red wine  
150ml (¼ pint) water  
3 tbs tomato purée  
1 large aubergine/eggplant, sliced  
300ml (½ pint) thick white sauce  
100g (4oz) grated cheese

## Directions
Pre-heat the oven to 200 C/400 F/Gas Mark 6. Fry the onion and minced meat for 4-5 minutes. Blend the spices with the water and tomato purée and add to the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes.  
Layer the mince mixture and aubergine/eggplant in an ovenproof dish, finishing with aubergine/eggplant. Top with the white sauce and sprinkle with the grated cheese. Bake for 40 minutes.  
Serve with a crisp green salad.

## Hints & Tips
Replace half of the aubergine/eggplant with sliced potatoes. For a change, place the mince mixture in an ovenproof dish and top with mashed potato and grated cheese and bake until browned.
