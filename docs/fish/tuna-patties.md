# Tuna Patties

## Ingredients
425 g can tuna in springwater, drained and moisture squeezed out  
3 large eggs, lightly beaten  
1 brown onion, diced  
3 spring onions, thinly sliced  
1 cup cooked corn kernels  
1/2 cup breadcrumbs  
Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions
Break up the tuna into small flakes with your fingers, then stir through the chopped onion, corn kernels and spring onion till thoroughly mixed. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir the egg into the mixture till it is wet, then slowly add the breadcrumbs till the mixture holds together (but is not doughy).  
Heat some oil in a frying pan then shape 2 tbsp of the mixture into a small patty with wet hands, then place in the pan to fry. Flip over once golden, and drain on a paper towel. Repeat with remaining mixture.  
Serve with fresh veggies and with a spicy, fruity salsa or chutney, or sweet chilli sauce in a pinch.  
These are freezable!

## My Notes
I used frozen corn, microwaved for a few seconds to warm it up a bit. For those of us in the UK who donâ€™t get massive cans of tuna: The cans I have are 185 grams net weight, 130 grams drained, so I drained 3 cans, used 2 1/2 cans of it, and threw the leftover drained tuna into a pasta salad the next day. ðŸ˜‰
