# Baked Lime & Herb Salmon

## Ingredients
2 salmon steaks, fresh or frozen  
2 teaspoons dill  
1 teaspoon garlic powder  
lime juice – dash  
olive oil – dash

## Directions
Combine herbs, lime juice and olive oil. Brush over salmon steaks, wrap loosely in foil, place on baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 400F/200C/Gas Mark 6 for 20 – 30 minutes (depending if salmon is fresh or frozen.)

## My Notes
My steaks were frozen, so took 30 min in my oven. We’ve also used coley and haddock instead of salmon. I don’t really like cooking fish on the hob, so this is a nice option for us.
