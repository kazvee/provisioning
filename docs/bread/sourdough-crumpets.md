# Sourdough Crumpets

## Ingredients
227 grams (1 cup) of sourdough starter discard  
1 teaspoon sugar  
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt  
3/8 teaspoon baking soda (If your discard is especially sour, increase this to 1/2 teaspoon.)

## Directions
In a medium bowl, mix the sourdough starter discards, sugar, salt, and baking soda. The batter should rise and develop some bubbles/froth.  
Heat a bit of oil in a frying pan on Medium heat, and pour some batter into the pan to make 4 crumpets of 1/4 cup of batter each. (You can use 4 x egg rings if preferred.)  
Cook for about 5 minutes, until the tops are set and full of small holes.  
Flip them over (remove the egg rings, if using) and cook for another 3 minutes or so until golden on the bottom. These can be eaten as-is or toasted before serving.

### My Notes
On the first attempt, I only had a weekâ€™s worth of sourdough starter discard so I scaled the recipe down and used 75g discard, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp sugar, and a pinch of salt.

Second batch: 160g discard, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp salt. This was too much for only 2 egg rings, should have used 4.
