# Carrot and Chickpea Salad with Tahini

## Ingredients For The Salad
1 3/4 cups cooked chickpeas (or a 15 ounce can), drained well. (Pat dry using paper towel)  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt  
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin  
1 pound carrots, peeled and coarsely grated  
1/4 cup parsley, coarsely chopped  
1/4 salted pistachios, shelled and coarsely chopped

## Ingredients For The Dressing
1 medium garlic clove, minced  
1/4 cup lemon juice  
3 tablespoons tahini (well-stirred)  
2 tablespoons water (plus more if needed)  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
Salt  
Red pepper flakes

## Directions for the Salad
Preheat your oven to 425F. Toss the chickpeas with the oil, salt, and cumin until well coated. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 15 – 20 minutes until browned and crisp, tossing them occasionally throughout to ensure they toast evenly. Set aside.

## Directions for the Dressing
Whisk all the dressing ingredients together until smooth, adding a bit more water to thin it out if needed.  
In a separate bowl, combine the carrots and parsley. Pour 2/3 of the dressing over and combine well. Season to taste. Garnish with chickpeas and pistachios.  
If preparing this ahead of time, add the chickpeas and pistachios right before serving.

## My Notes
I didn’t roast the chickpeas first, just drained from the can and rinsed well. I skipped adding any water, or salt or garlic flakes. I used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder in the dressing instead of the fresh garlic clove. I didn’t have pistachios so used about 1/4 cup of Zante currants. I used a food processor to shred the carrots.

Husband prefers this salad to the other carrot salad I made recently. I prefer [the other recipe](carrot-chickpea-salad.md)! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
