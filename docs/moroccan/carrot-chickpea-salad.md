# Moroccan Carrot and Chickpea Salad
Serves: 6 (as a side dish)

## Ingredients For the Dressing
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil  
1 teaspoon lemon zest  
3 tablespoons lemon juice  
1/4 cup orange juice  
1 1/2 tablespoons honey  
3/4 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon ground cumin  
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger  
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander  
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice  
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Ingredients For the Salad
1 pound carrots, peeled and coarsely grated  
1/3 cup currants  
1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted  
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint or cilantro (or a combo), plus more to serve/garnish  
1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained  
2 tablespoons shallots, finely minced  
1 clove garlic, minced

## Directions
Add the dressing ingredients to a mixing bowl or jug, and whisk well to combine.  
In a separate large bowl, combine the salad ingredients.  
Whisk the dressing again, pour over salad and keep covered in the fridge for at least 30 min, and up to a few hours.

## My Notes
I used a 1 kg bag (so 2.2 pounds) of carrots, and 2 cans of chickpeas. I didn‚Äôt use almonds because I don‚Äôt like them. I didn‚Äôt have orange juice so I used Tropical Juice from a juicebox. üòÄ Skipped the lemon zest because no lemons in the house. You see a pattern with how I cook now, yes? I used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder because I didn‚Äôt have fresh garlic in the house. I used Maple Syrup instead of honey because I‚Äôm Canadian. üòâ  

I chopped up the carrots into small cubes by hand, but worth dragging out the footstool to get the food processor off the top of the fridge to save time the next time I make this, though!  

The mint used was a combo of Chocolate Mint, Apple Mint, and Moroccan Mint since I have them all in my garden and I try not to play favourites. ‚ù§Ô∏è  

I also added 1 tablespoon of Pomegranate syrup because when we were shopping for ingredients I thought we needed some for the recipe so I figured I‚Äôd follow through.

This turned out really nice, we‚Äôve enjoyed it for work lunches. Some pistachios sprinkled on top before serving would probably work nicely, too. Definitely worth making again.
