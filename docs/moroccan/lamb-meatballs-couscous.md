# Moroccan Lamb Meatballs with Harissa Couscous
Serves: 4

## Ingredients for the Meatballs
2 teaspoons cumin seeds  
2 tablespoons coriander seed  
50 grams breadcrumbs  
1 garlic clove, crushed  
500 grams lamb mince  
juice of 1 lemon  
1 egg, lightly beaten  
20 grams fresh mint, chopped  
2-3 tablespoons sunflower oil  
150 ml plain/natural yoghurt, to serve

## Ingredients for the Couscous
300 grams couscous  
50 grams butter  
2 tablespoons harissa, to serve

## Directions 
Heat a dry frying pan on low heat and add your spices. Toast them for a few minutes, then remove from the pan, crush using a mortar and pestle, and set aside for later.

In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons of water, and garlic. Mix well, then add the lamb, lemon juice, crushed spices, egg, and most of the chopped mint, seasoning to taste. Mix well and form into 16 meatballs. Cover and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

When ready to cook, heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the meatballs for 6 – 7 minutes, until golden brown on all sides and cooked through. Cover and keep warm.

Place the couscous in a medium heatproof bowl, and mix in the butter and harissa. Pour in 400ml of boiling water. Cover and leave to sit for 10 minutes. When cooked, fluff the couscous to soften it and serve it alongside the meatballs, with some yoghurt and harissa.

## My Notes
I didn’t have lemons so I used 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice. I used vegetable oil instead of sunflower oil.  
These turned out really well. A little more delicate than expected so caution is needed when frying them so they don’t break apart in the frying pan when you turn them.  
The meatballs freeze well.
