# Slow Cooker Lamb Ras el Hanout

## Ingredients
1 kg lamb shoulder (or other braising cut)  
2 teaspoons Ras El Hanout  
1 tablespoons vegetable oil  
1 large onion  
2 – 3 cloves of garlic  
2 tablespoons honey  
1 can chopped tomatoes  
150 ml lamb stock  
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves  
salt, to taste  
freshly ground pepper, to taste

## Directions
Sauté the onion in a frying pan until golden. Remove and place in the slow cooker. Cut the lamb into chunks and brown in the frying pan. When done, place in the slow cooker with all other ingredients. Cook on Low for 8 hours.

## My Notes
I didn’t bother slicing the meat into chunks, and used maple syrup instead of honey. Low for 6 hours left the meat fall-off-the bone.
