# Oven Baked Lamb Meatballs

## Ingredients
1 lb minced lamb (or beef)  
1 egg  
Tomato sauce (with olive oil, salt, parsley, and a tablespoon of chili paste or harissa.)  
2 shallots or one small sweet onion diced and caramelised  
1/5 cup fresh parsley or coriander  
1 teaspoon garlic, chopped  
1 tablespoon salt  
1 tablespoon paprika  
1 tablespoon cumin  
1 teaspoon white pepper  
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Directions
In a large bowl, whisk the egg and spices. Add meat and combine well. Form into meatballs and bake in an oven preheated to 150C / 300F for 25 minutes or so.  
In a large pot, heat the tomato sauce on low heat and add in the meatballs. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through.

## My Notes
I've used beef mince instead of lamb sometimes. I never use harissa or chili paste because I'm a wimp. ðŸ™„  
For the tomato sauce I used a hand blender on 2 x 400 gram cans of chopped tomatoes, and added about 1 teaspoon of curry powder. I added in about 6 caramelised shallots and 50 grams of finely chopped mint because I had loads of it to use from the garden. Maybe next time I'll use a second can of tomatoes for even more sauce.  
When doubled, I found the white pepper a bit too strong so I won't double that next time I make a big batch. This freezes well.
