# Moroccan Beef Tagine with Green Couscous
Serves 6 â€“ 8

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons paprika  
1 tablespoons each ground coriander and turmeric  
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
2 teaspoons coarse ground black pepper  
1.5 kg (3 lb, 5 oz) beef chuck or blade, well trimmed and cut into 2.5cm (1in) chunks  
2 garlic cloves, chopped  
2.5 cm (1 inch) piece peeled root ginger, chopped  
3 onions, roughly chopped  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
600 ml (1 pint) tomato juice  
600 ml (1 pint) beef or chicken stock  
2 tablespoons clear honey

## For the Couscous:
350 g (12 oz) couscous  
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  
juice of 2 lemons  
600 ml (1 pint) chicken stock  
4 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and mint  
50g (2 oz) flaked almonds, toasted  
sea salt and freshly-ground black pepper  
Greek-style yoghurt and fresh coriander leaves, to garnish

## Directions
Mix the paprika, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin and pepper together in a large bowl, then tip half into a small bowl and set aside. Add the beef to the large bowl, coat well with the spices. Cover with clingfilm and chill overnight. Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3. Place the garlic, ginger and onions into a food processor and pulse until finely minced.

Heat a large heavy-based casserole, add half of the oil and brown off the marinated beef in batches. Add the remaining oil to the pan and then add the onion mixture. Cook for a few minutes until softened but not coloured. Stir in the reserved spice mixture and cook for another minute or so until well combined.

Pour the tomato juice and stock into the pan and then add the browned beef with the honey, stirring to combine. Bring to the boil, then cover and transfer to the oven.

Cook for 2 hours until the beef is completely tender and sauce has thickened and reduced.
