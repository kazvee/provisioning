# Slow Cooker Moroccan Chicken Stew
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
4 carrots, chopped  
2 large onions, chopped  
1.3 kg (2 lbs) chicken pieces (boneless and skinless)  
1/2 cup raisins  
1/2 cup dried apricots, coarsely chopped  
400ml (14 oz) chicken broth/stock  
1/4 cup tomato paste  
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  
2 tablespoons lemon juice  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin  
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper  
Pine nuts, toasted (for garnish, optional)  
Fresh coriander (for garnish, optional)

## Directions
Place the carrots and onions into the slow cooker, place the chicken pieces on top, and finally add the apricots and raisins on top.
In a small bowl, whisk the chicken broth, tomato paste, flour, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, and black pepper. Pour on top of the mixture in the slowcooker, and cover.
Cook on Low for 6.5 to 7 hours, or on High for 3.5 to 4 hours.
Garnish with pine nuts and/or coriander before serving.
Serve with couscous, rice, whatever you want.

## My Notes
I didnâ€™t fry the chicken or onions beforehand. This turned out really well, the sauce was quite thick. I only used 1kg of chicken, and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  
Next time Iâ€™ll add a bit (a very small bit) of chili powder or paprika to give it a little tiny bit of heat. Will make again! ðŸ™‚
