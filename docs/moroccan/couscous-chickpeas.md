# Moroccan Couscous and Chickpeas

## Ingredients
100 grams couscous  
1 (19 ounces) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed well  
1/2 cup raisins  
1/2 teaspoon onion powder  
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander  
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger  
160 ml water, boiled  
1 lemon, zest and juice (About 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice)  
Salt, to taste  
Pepper, to taste

## Directions
In a heat-proof bowl, combine dry couscous, all spices, and raisins. Bring 160 ml water to the boil, and pour over the dry mixture. Add in the lemon juice, stir well, and cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes.  
When the couscous are done, fluff with a fork. Add in the drained chickpeas, and stir well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## My Notes
I used Zante currants instead of raisins. My first attempt was okay but I like a lot of flavour, so the next time I made this I threw a stock cube into the boiling water. I used chicken but itâ€™d be just as nice with a vegetarian one. ðŸ™‚
