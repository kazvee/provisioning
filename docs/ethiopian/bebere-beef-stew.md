# Berbere Beef Stew

## Ingredients
1 lb ground beef  
1 onion, chopped  
1 red pepper, chopped  
2 cloves garlic, sliced  
1 knob ginger, grated  
2 tablespoons Berbere spice  
2 tablespoons tomato purée  
3 tomatoes, chopped  
500 ml beef stock  
salt & pepper, to taste  
oil, for frying

## Directions
In a large pot with a lid, brown the meat in some oil, then remove and set aside for now. In the same pot, sauté the onion, peppers, ginger, garlic, and Berbere for 5 – 8 minutes until softened. Add tomato purée and cook for another minute or so.
Return the cooked beef to the pan, add the chopped tomato and beef stock.
Simmer on Low until thickened.

## My Notes
I used most of a 400ml can of whole tomatoes instead of fresh. I didn’t have beef stock so made chicken stock with cubes instead. I used mixed peppers instead of just red. I used Knorr brand Berbere spice blend. This made 3 meals for us (smaller portions).
