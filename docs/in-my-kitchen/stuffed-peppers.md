# Stuffed Bell Peppers with Couscous & Mushrooms

## Ingredients
2 large bell peppers (yellow, orange, or green â€” but I prefer red)  
100 grams couscous, cooked (directions vary, so check your package directions)  
1 clove of garlic, finely chopped  
125 grams chestnut mushrooms, chopped  
2 teaspoons olive oil  
salt  
pepper

## Directions
Slice the peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Scatter garlic over the peppers, drizzle with oilve oil. Mix the mushrooms with the cooked couscous and stuff the peppers with this mixture. Drizzle a little more olive oil on top if desired.

Place peppers on a baking tray and cook in an oven preheated to 400F / 200C / Gas Mark 6 for 15 â€“ 20 minutes.

## My Notes
If, like me, you end up with too much stuffing sometimes, you can add a little more olive oil to the leftovers, form it into a ball with your hands, and bake the couscous balls on the baking tray next to the stuffed peppers â€” they should hold their form while baking, just be careful when you serve, as they are fragile and prone to falling apart. ðŸ˜‰
