# Sourdough Banana Pancakes (made with discard)
Serves: 2  
*Something new I tried, based on my existing recipe for [Blueberry & Banana Pancakes](blueberry-banana-pancakes.md)!*

## Ingredients
125 grams of sourdough starter discard (100% hydration)  
2 eggs  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
30 ml milk  
50 grams sugar  
1 banana, mashed  
1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional, but recommended)

## Directions
Mash the banana and set aside. Beat the egg and set aside. Mix the other ingredients, except for the baking powder, in a large bowl. Add in the egg and banana, and stir well. Get everything ready to start cooking, then add in the baking powder. Let it sit for a minute or 2, then pour out portions of batter into a large frying pan on medium heat. Flip to ensure both sides are cooked. Serve with maple syrup.

## My Notes
I might try leaving out the milk (or the egg?) next time to see if that yields firmer pancakes.
