# Blueberry & Banana Pancakes - with sticky maple pecans
Serves: 2 very hungry people

## Ingredients for the Pancakes
3 large eggs, separated  
125 grams plain flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
50 grams sugar  
150 ml milk  
150 grams blueberries  
1 large (or 2 small) bananas, peeled and mashed  
vegetable oil for cooking  
maple syrup to serve

## Ingredients for the Sticky Maple Pecans
100 g pecan nuts  
5 tablespoons maple syrup

## Directions for the Sticky Maple Pecans
Heat a frying pan and add the pecan nuts. Toss them around in the pan until they start to toast and become slightly darker, this will bring out a more intense pecan flavour. Pour the maple syrup into the pan and stir to coat the pecans, letting the syrup bubble and thicken slightly, so the pecans become sticky. Remove from heat and set aside.

## Directions for the Pancakes
Mix together the egg yolks, flour, baking powder, sugar and milk until you have a smooth, thick batter. Stir in the blueberries and mashed banana. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold ino the batter and your pancake mixture is ready to cook.

Heat a frying pan over medium heat, and brush with a little vegetable oil. Spoon some batter into the pan (how much depends on how large you want your pancakes to be!) and cook for a few minutes, then flip with a spatula and cook for another minute or 2 until both sides are lightly golden. Keep the pancakes warm while you continue to cook the rest.

Serve hot, with the sticky maple pecans spooned over the top.

## My Notes
Iâ€™ve never made this with the pecans. Other times, Iâ€™ve skipped the blueberries when I havenâ€™t had them in the house or didnâ€™t want such a filling meal. It still turns out great. ðŸ™‚ Usually, Iâ€™m lazy and donâ€™t bother separating the eggs. The pancakes are still great, just a smidge less fluffy, I think.
