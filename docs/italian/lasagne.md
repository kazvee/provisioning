# Lasagne
*Not so much a recipe as it is a reminder to myself of general guidelines when I prep my 4 x loaf pans for make-ahead lasagne.*

3 tbsp tomato pur√©e  
1 teaspoon Fennel seeds  
1 teaspoon thyme  
150ml beef stock (1 cube)  
2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes  
1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed  
Spinach (thawed from frozen)  
Ricotta cheese  
Mozzarella cheese (grated)  
Veg (fried onions, shredded carrots, sliced mushrooms, whatever)
