# Garlic Spaghetti Pasta - Spaghetti Aglio e Olio
Serves: 2

## Ingredients
150 grams dried spaghetti pasta  
1.5 tablespoons olive oil  
2 – 10 cloves garlic (I used 6!), thinly sliced (or finely chopped, or minced, as per your preference)  
juice of 1/2 a lemon (1 tablespoon of bottled lemon juice)  
1 cup of the water the pasta was cooked in  
parsley, finely chopped  
salt, to taste  
pepper, to taste

## Directions
Boil the pasta in salted water until al dente. Make sure to conserve 1 cup of the cooking water when you drain it! Peel and slice/chop/mince the garlic. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan (that can also hold the cooked pasta!) on medium high heat until the garlic is golden brown. Add in the drained cooked pasta, parsley, and 1 cup of the reserved paste cooking water to the pan. Mix well. Add lemon juice, mix again, and serve. You can top this with parmesan cheese if you wish. 

## My Notes
I used 6 garlic cloves, but apparently the guidance is 1 clove per person. I used 200g spaghettini, since we were really hungry. Skipped the parsley since I didn’t have any in the house. You can also add 1/2 a red pepper, or some mushrooms, fried in the pan after the garlic is added.
