# Chocolate Biscotti

## Ingredients
200 grams flour  
60 grams quality cocoa powder  
175 grams caster sugar  
1/2 to 1 cup dried cranberries (I used 1 cup, but forgot to weigh them)  
1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
4 tablespoons cold butter  
2 eggs, lightly beaten

## Directions
In a food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Blend or pulse until uniformly combined.  
Add in the butter and vanilla extract and blend/pulse again until well-combined.  
At this point, I found it easier to empty the mixture into a large bowl.  
Add in the eggs, mixing well with a wooden spoon until completely incorporated.  
Add in the dried cranberries and mix well.  
Divide your dough into 4 portions of equal size and form into log shapes onto a baking sheet.  
Bake in an oven preheated to 180C / 350F for 25 minutes.  
Remove from oven, allow to cool enough so you can touch them, and slice diagonally into 1-inch slices.  
Turn the slices on their sides, and return to the oven to bake for another 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes.  
Cool and store in an airtight container.

## My Notes
I used margarine instead of butter as it‚Äôs all I had in the house. I halved this recipe the first time I made it, and used my other biscotti recipe as a starting point to make a mango-flavoured version.  
The chocolate batch turned out quite ‚Äúartisan‚Äù in appearance üò¨ so I don‚Äôt think I blended the final dough enough. I also had to extend the final baking time by another 10 minutes or so. It still tasted fantastic though, so I‚Äôll definitely make these again!  

## Doubling this Recipe
While this recipe probably doubles well, if you have a 2.1 litre food processor you‚Äôll need to do it in 2 separate batches!
