# Cranberry & Cinnamon Sourdough Biscotti

## Ingredients
1 cup (between 227 ‚Äì 241 grams / approx 8 to 8 1/2 ounces) sourdough starter (100% hydration)  
2 eggs  
2 teaspoon vanilla  
1 cup brown sugar  
1/2 cup butter, softened  
1 1/2 cups flour (Note: You may need up to 1 cup additional flour!)  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon cinnamon  
5 oz cinnamon chips (optional)  
4 oz white chocolate, for drizzling (optional)

## Directions
In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the sourdough starter, eggs, vanilla extract, and brown sugar. Add in the flour, cinnamon, and salt and mix. The dough should be kind of stiff but not overly dry, similar to cookie dough. (Note: You may need up to 1 cup additional flour!) Mix on low speed for 5 minutes. Add in the butter and cinnamon chips (if using) and mix until blended.  
Place the dough onto parchment paper lined baking sheet, forming it into a log shape in the middle of the pan. Cover with cling film and allow to rise for 3 to 5 hours, although it will not rise very much.

Bake, in an oven preheated to 325F / 160C for 35 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes or so. In the meantime, turn down the oven temperature to 250F / 120C.

Using a bread knife, cut the log into slices 3/4 inch thick. Making sure there‚Äôs enough room between slices, arrange them standing up on the baking sheet. Bake for another 40 minutes at 250F / 120C.

When done, place onto a wire rack to cool. In the meantime, if using the white chocolate, break it into pieces in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the chocolate for 30 seconds, then stir, and heat again in 10 second increments, stirring in between, until it‚Äôs fully melted. Drizzle it over the biscotti and allow to cool.

## My Notes
I didn‚Äôt use the white chocolate part of this recipe. Instead of cinnamon chips, I used orange flavoured dried cranberries, and my batch did need about 1 cup of extra flour. I lay the slices down for the 2nd bake, as I don‚Äôt believe it makes a difference.  
Maybe next time I should make the slices a bit thinner. Worth making again and I‚Äôll definitely be getting some cinnamon chips for my future batches! üòç
