# Calzone (or Pizza) Dough

## Ingredients
3/4 cup (6 ounces) lukewarm water  
1 teaspoon active dry or instant yeast (Note: I used 1 package.)  
2 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all purpose flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons salt  
Olive oil (optional)

## Directions
In a large bowl, combine the warm water and yeast, stirring to combine. Add the flour and salt, and mix until you have a loose dough.  
Turn the dough and any loose flour left in the bowl out onto your work surface. Knead for about 5 minutes to incorporate all the loose flour and form a smooth, elastic dough. The dough should not stick to your hands or countertop. If it does, work in more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until itâ€™s moist and only slightly sticky.

If you donâ€™t need to use the dough right away, let it rise (covered with a large bowl or clean kitchen towel) for an hour and a half, until doubled in size. You can then use or keep it in the fridge for up to 3 days. (The dough is pretty workable from cold but if it shrinks back when you roll it, just let it sit for 5 minutes and try again.)

## Divide the dough:
a) into 2 parts for pizzas (I havenâ€™t tried this yet.)  
b) into 10 parts for calzones  

Stuff the calzones, making sure to seal them well and slice vents in the top so they donâ€™t explode in the oven. ðŸ˜‰  
Brush the tops with olive oil if desired. Bake in an oven preheated to 400F/200C for 15 to 20 minutes (your oven may be different).  

Reheat any leftovers from the fridge in an oven preheated to 400F/200C for about 12 to 15 minutes or until heated through.  
Or, Iâ€™m told you can reheat them in the microwave in 1-minute bursts on High, for up to 3 minutes until heated through.  
These can also be frozen and then thawed in the fridge or reheated right from frozen.

## My Notes
I used a 12cm diameter dumpling mould, similar to the middle one in the image, and I got 11 calzones from the dough. A portion for a hungry person would be 3 â€“ 4 of them.  
For my latest filling, I used a total of 1/3 cup red pizza sauce across all calzones, plus cheese, spinach, bacon, and onion.  
Previously, Iâ€™ve filled these with 1/3 cup red pizza sauce (across all of them), cooked prawns, sundried tomato, shredded mozzarella, and leftover cooked onions and mushrooms.

Reheating the leftovers took 12 minutes at 400F/200C (preheated).

Next time Iâ€™ll try a cheese spinach filling:  
1 onion, diced and sautÃ©ed until softened  
2 â€“ 3 garlic cloves, minced and sautÃ©ed until softened  
6 ounces baby spinach (wilted in the pan towards the end of cooking the onion and garlic)  
1/2 cup ricotta cheese  
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded  
1/2 cup tomato sauce
