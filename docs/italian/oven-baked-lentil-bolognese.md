# Oven Baked Lentil Bolognese
*(This is the original recipe, but I doubled it and modified it as per my notes at the bottom.)*

## Ingredients
2 x 400g cans of peeled plum tomatoes  
200g Puy lentils (rinsed and drained)  
2 carrots, grated  
1 brown onion, grated  
2 cloves of garlic, sliced  
1 Knorr Paprika and Sundried Tomato Stock Pot  
100g breadcrumbs  
100g strong hard cheese, grated  
1 lemon zest  
1/2 bunch fresh oregano leaves  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1 packet of spaghetti cooked al dente

## Directions
Pour the tomatoes into a large roasting pan and crush gently with a potato masher to break them up. Add in the lentils, carrots, onion, garlic, and stock pot. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C/350F for 35 to 40 minutes, until the lentils are tender and cooked through.
Meanwhile, on a tray, combine the breadcrumbs, grated cheese, lemon zest, oregano, and olive oil to make a pangrattato. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, until golden and crisp.
Cook the spaghetti al dente and toss in a drizzle of oil to stop it from sticking together.
Spoon the bolognese sauce over the pasta and top with the crispy pangrattato.

## My Notes
I only made the sauce and used the above for inspiration.  
I used 4 cans of tomatoes (2 were whole peeled and 2 were pre-chopped in the can), 400g brown lentils (soaked while I got everything else ready, then drained), 2 tablespoons of tomato paste (instead of the stock pot), 1kg of carrots, 4 red peppers and 1 green pepper (chopped into 1/2inch pieces), and Italian seasonings that I didnâ€™t measure. ðŸ™‚  
It took a bit longer to cook, 50min in my oven. This made 16 single-serving portions, most of which we froze for another time.
