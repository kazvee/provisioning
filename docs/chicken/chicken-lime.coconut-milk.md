# Chicken with Lime and Coconut Milk

## Ingredients
150 ml coconut milk  
2 teaspoons olive oil  
2 skinless chicken breasts  
zest and juice of 1 large lime  
1 green chili, deseeded and finely chopped  
2 teaspoons Thai fish sauce  
4 tablespoons fresh coriander leaves  
4 spring onions cut into 1 inch shreds  

## Directions
Chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces and place them in a bowl with the lime juice and zest to marinate for an hour.

Stir-fry chicken pieces for 3-4 minutes, then add the chili, stir-fry for 1 more minute, and add the coconut milk, fish sauce and half the coriander and spring onions.

Cook for another 1-2 minutes and serve with Thai fragrant rice.

## My Notes
I loved this! My husband wasnâ€™t as enthused.
