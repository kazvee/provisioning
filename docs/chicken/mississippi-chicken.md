# Slow Cooker Mississippi Chicken
*(An alternative to the [Mississippi Beef Pot Roast](/docs/beef/mississippi-pot-roast.md) Recipe!)*

🍲 Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1 x 5.5 lb whole chicken  
1 packet ranch dressing mix  
1 packet 'au jus' gravy mix  
113 grams (1/4 cup) butter (optional: skip if using a whole chicken. If using chicken breasts, consider adding butter)  
4 – 5 pepperoncini peppers (or more!)  
1/4 cup – 1/2 cup brine from the jar of pepperoncini peppers (optional)

## Directions
Unwrap the chicken, remove any insides, and pat dry with a paper towel. Lay the chicken on the bottom of the slow cooker — on top of some foil balls, or a rack, or some vegetables, to keep the chicken out of the cooking juices, if desired.  
Sprinkle the spice mixes on top, then add slices of butter (if using), and place the pepperoncini peppers on top. Pour the pepperoncini brine around the sides, if using.  
Cover and cook on High for 4 hours or Low for 6-8 hours.  
Optional: When done, you can place the chicken (carefully, as it will fall apart!) on a baking sheet and put it under the oven broiler for 5 minutes or so to get the skin crispy.

## My Notes
We got a Medium chicken which was 1.2kg (1.645lbs) and I cooked it a total of 6 hours, on High for the first 1hour, then on Low for the remaining 5 hours.  
I didn’t use butter. I used lombardi peppers, and no brine, instead of the pepperoncini. I didn’t have any au jus mix, so left it out. I also added in potatoes, cut into quarters, at the bottom of the slow cooker to keep the chicken out of the juices. And I added in some large chunks of carrots around the sides.  
I used a thermometer to check before serving, as I’d read that USDA recommends 165°F as the safe eating temperature for chicken and they say chicken is done when meat temperature registers 165°F in the breast or 175°F-180°F in the thickest part of the thigh. The juices should also run clear.  
We enjoyed this, it was nice and easy to make, Mr especially liked the vegetables.
