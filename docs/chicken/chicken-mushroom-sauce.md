# Chicken in Mushroom Sauce

## Ingredients
4 boneless chicken breasts, cut into escalopes of about 100g / 4oz each  
2 tablespoons flour  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
3 garlic cloves, sliced  
1 – 2 red chilis, finely sliced and deseeded
1 medium onion, chopped into wedges  
175 grams (6 oz) chestnut mushrooms, sliced  
300 ml (1/2 pint) chicken stock  
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce  
1 tablespoon medium dry sherry  
3 tablespoons half fat crème fraîche  
1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley, for garnish

## Directions
Coat the chicken in the flour. In a large frying pan, heat half (1 tablespoon) of the oil and brown the chicken all over. Remove from heat and set aside for now.

Pour the other half (1 tablespoon) of oil into the pan and sauté the garlic, chili, and onion for 3 minutes or so. Add in the mushrooms and fry for another 3 minutes or so untilk the onions and mushroom are softened but not browned. Add in the rest of the flour slowly, stirring well to avoid lumps, and cook for another couple of minutes.

Add in the chicken stock and soy sauce, and bring the pan to the boil. Reduce the heat, and return the chicken to the pan. Cover and simmer for 4-6 minutes or until the meat is cooked through. 

Add in the sherry and creme fraîche, stir, and cook for another couple of minutes. Serve over pasta noodes or anything else you prefer.

## My Notes
We used Shaoxing rice wine instead of sherry, and prepared about 125 grams of pasta noodles for the both of us. We’ve also used turkey instead of chicken sometimes.
