# Sweet & Spicy Ginger Lime Chicken
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
6 tablespoons soy sauce  
4 tablespoons lime juice  
2 tablespoons sunflower oil  
1 green chilli, seeded and chopped  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1 (2cm) piece fresh root ginger, minced  
1 teaspoon ground coriander  
2 tablespoons dark brown soft sugar  
2 tablespoons lime zest  
6 (175g) skin-on, boneless chicken breast fillets  
1 tablespoon cornflour  
1 tablespoon water

## Directions
In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, lime juice, oil, chilli, garlic, ginger, coriander, sugar, and lime zest and whisk well, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add the chicken, mix well to coat the meat, and refrigerate (covered) for at least 2 hours.

Once marinated, remove the chicken from the marinade and set the liquids aside for now. Pan fry the chicken over medium-high heat, or bake in the oven until cooked throughout.

Pour the remaining marinade into a small pot. In a separate small container, dissolve the cornflour in the water to make a thick paste. Add this paste to the reserved marinade and stir well. Bring this mixture to the boil, then reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour this sauce over the chicken to serve.

## My Notes
I left out the chili and lime zest. Instead of fresh garlic, I used 2 teaspoons powdered. In place of the fresh ginger, I used 1 teaspoon powdered. I substituted the sunflower oil with vegetable oil, used and bottled lemon juice instead of lime juice, and used gram flour (chickpea flour) instead of cornflour.  
I marinated my chicken overnight (about 12 hours) and baked in the oven, preheated to 400F/200C, for 30 minutes, covering for the last 10 minutes. Turned out very nice. ðŸ™‚
