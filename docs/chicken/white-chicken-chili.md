# Slow Cooker White Chicken Chili

🍲 Slow Cooker Recipe

## Ingredients
1 kg (2.2 lbs) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves  
2 cans (295 g / 10.5 oz) condensed cream of chicken soup  
4 medium green bell peppers, diced (about 3 cups)  
4 cups frozen whole kernel corn, thawed  
1-2 tablespoons minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce  
1 can (about 15 oz) white cannellini beans, rinsed and drained  
1 can (about 15 oz) butter beans, rinsed and drained  
2 teaspoons ground cumin  
lime wedges (optional)  
4 tablespoons chopped coriander/cilantro (optional)

## Directions
Lightly grease the bottom & sides of a 6-quart slow cooker, and add in the soup, peppers, corn, chipotle chilies, beans, and cumin. Add in the chicken, and stir until well-mixed.  
Cook on Low for 6-7 hours (or High for 3-4 hours) until the chicken is tender and cooked through.  
If desired, remove the chicken to a cutting board, shred it, and re-add it to the chili. Garnish with lime wedges and coriander to serve.

## My Notes
The above is a doubled recipe because I’ve got a large slow cooker. We enjoyed this more than the earlier white chili I made, so I’ve removed the older recipe from my site.

The original recipe just called for canellini beans but as I was doubling I thought I’d add a different bean in there, too. I diced the chicken into large pieces at the start so didn’t need to shred the meat at the end.  
I didn’t use chilies in adobo sauce, as we don’t buy them, but I used a little under 1 tablespoon of Harissa paste instead. I had frozen mixed bell pepper slices in the house so used about 400g of those. I didn’t pre-thaw the corn or the pepper slices. I also added in about 1 cup of caramelised onions I had in the freezer from something else. I didn’t have fresh coriander so used about 2 teaspoons of dried coriander powder.  
I cooked it all on High for 4 hours.  
This made 10 single portions with most frozen for another time.
