# Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Tahini & Sun Dried Tomato

## Ingredients
1/2 cup sundried tomatoes, chopped  
3 tablespoons tahini  
2 chicken breasts (boneless & skinless)

## Directions
If your sundried tomatoes are dry, place them in simmering water for 3 minutes or so, drain, and chop. If youâ€™re using oil-packed tomatoes, remove the necessary amount from the jar and let them rest on a paper towel for a little while to drain off some of the oil, then chop.  
Butterfly the chicken breasts, stuff each one with 1.5 tablespoons of tahini and sun dried tomatoes, and season the outside with salt & pepper.  
Place on baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 375F / 190C for approximately 40 minutes until cooked through.
