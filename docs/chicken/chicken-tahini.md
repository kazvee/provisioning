# Chicken Thighs with Tahini

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons tahini  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
3 garlic cloves, minced to a paste  
1 teaspoon smoked paprika (not the spicy hot kind)  
1 teaspoon ground cumin  
Juice of 1 large lemon  
6 chicken thighs, skin on (bone-in or boneless)  
Salt, to taste

## Directions
In a large bowl (preferably one with a lid), combine the tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, paprika, and cumin. Add the chicken thighs and stir well until all the meat is coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours.  
When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375F/190C (Fan 180C) and cook the chicken until the juices run clear when pierced with a knife. Oven times may vary, so ensure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165C.

## My Notes
I made a smaller 1/3 portion of the marinade as I only had 6 chicken drumsticks, and this took 30 min in my fan-assisted oven at 180C. This is definitely something weâ€™ll make again since we usually have tahini in the house for homemade hummus.
