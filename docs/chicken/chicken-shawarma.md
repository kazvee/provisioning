# Chicken Shawarma

## Ingredients
1 kg boneless, skinless chicken breasts (whole or sliced into strips)  
1/2 cup plain yoghurt  
1 tablespoon garlic, minced  
1 tablespoon lemon juice  
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon oregano  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  

## Directions
Combine the yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic, cinnamon, oregano, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Add the chicken and stir well to coat the meat. Refrigerate covered for 4 to 24 hours.

Remove the meat from the marinade and either pan fry over medium-high heat, or bake in the oven until cooked throughout.

## My Notes
I marinated the chicken overnight (about 12 hours), and covered the chicken for the final 10 minutes in the oven. We really enjoyed this! ðŸ˜€

*I still hate nutmeg, but I used it as per the recipe because it seemed harmless enough. My husbandâ€™s first comment upon tasting the chicken was, "Ooh, you can really taste the nutmeg in this!"" which is a complete lie, itâ€™s not even noticeable so I guess next time Iâ€™ll leave it out and not share food with my husband anymore.* ðŸ˜‰
