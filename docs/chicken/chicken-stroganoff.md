# Slow Cooker Chicken Stroganoff

## Ingredients
4 chicken breasts, cubed  
8 ounces mushrooms, sliced  
1 cup peas or other vegetables (frozen works fine!)  
1 cup sour cream (or non-dairy alternative)  
1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth  
1/2 cup onions, sliced  
1/4 cup dry white wine  
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  
1 bay leaf  
Paprika or tarragon for garnish (optional)

## Directions
In the bottom of the cooker stir together broth, wine, and Dijon mustard. Add onions, mushrooms and chicken. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and top with a bay leaf. Set the temperature to low and leave to cook for 5 hours.  
Once cooked, stir in the peas (or other vegetables) and sour cream, and let cook for a further 8-10 minutes. Serve, sprinkled with paprika or tarragon, over noodles or rice.

## My Notes
The last time I made this I added frozen veggies (carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower) about 2.5 hours in, which made them mushy. I added the sour cream during the last hour of the 5 hour cooking time, and it didn’t split.  
If using boneless chicken breasts again, I might adjust the total cooking time to only 4 hours, which should be long enough to cook the meat without overcooking it — we’ll see!
I don’t think 10 min is enough for that type of frozen veg, so maybe next time I’ll add them in for the last hour of cooking time, along with the sour cream since that worked well.
