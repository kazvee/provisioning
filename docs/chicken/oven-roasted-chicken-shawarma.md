# OvenÂ­ Roasted Chicken Shawarma
Serves: 6

## Ingredients
1 kg (2.2 lbs) boneless, skinless chicken thighs  
1 large red onion, peeled and quartered  
6 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and minced  
juice of 2 lemons (or 4 â€“ 6 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice)  
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil  
2 teaspoons cumin powder  
2 teaspoons paprika  
1/2 teaspoon turmeric  
pinch of ground cinnamon
red pepper flakes, to taste  
1 teaspoon kosher salt  
2 teaspoons black pepper  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Directions
In a large bowl, whisk lemon juice, 1/2 cup olive oil, garlic, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Add the chicken, stir well to coat. Cover and marinade in the fridge for 1 to 12 hours.

When ready to cook, add the onion to the marinade and stir well to coat.  
Place the chicken and onion pieces onto a cookie sheet greased with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  
Bake in an oven preheated to 220C / 425F for 30 â€“ 40 min or until cooked through and browned at the edges. Slice thinner if desires, garnish with parsley and serve.

## My Notes
For the juice of 2 lemons, I used about 4 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice. I used about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and an entire head of garlic (so about 12 cloves). I left out the the black pepper, red pepper flakes, and parsley entirely. I forgot to add in the onion but this still turned out great. This took about 22 minutes in my oven, and the olive oil made the kitchen quite smoky, but will make this again! ðŸ™‚
