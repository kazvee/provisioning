# Potato Pie – Patatnik

## Ingredients
3 – 4 medium-sized raw potatoes  
1 egg  
100 grams cheese, grated or chopped into small cubes  
1 teaspoon dried mint  
salt, to taste  
pepper, to taste  
Butter (or margarine, vegetable oil, olive oil, as per your preference) for the pan

## Directions
Wash, peel, and grate the potatoes. Combine with the rest of the ingredients. In a large pan, heat the oil and add a thin layer of the potato mixture. Brown on both sides, remove from heat, and keep warm while you cook the rest of the potato mixture. Serve hot.

### My Notes
I squeezed the grated potatoes as they had lots of water, but perhaps this step isn’t necessary. I used paneer cheese as it’s what I had in the house. I used my cast iron pan on the stovetop but apparently this can also be oven-baked, which I may try next time. We had these with some plain yoghurt garnish.
