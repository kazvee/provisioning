# Bacon-Wrapped Pork Stuffed with Black Pudding with Oven-Roasted Rhubarb

## Ingredients
2 pork fillets, about 350g (12oz) each  
250g black pudding, skinned and cut into slices  
12 thin rashers streaky bacon  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
1 tablespoon clear honey  
300g rhubarb, cut into 5cm lengths on the diagonal  
200 ml vegetable stock  
2 rounded tablespoons crÃ¨me fraÃ®che

## Directions
Butterfly slice the pork fillets, and smash with a meat tenderiser hammer (or rolling pin) to flatten well. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and lemon juice on all sides. Fill the meat with black pudding, then fold the pork over itself to enclose it all.  
Stretch and flatten the bacon rashers with the non-cutting edge of a butter knife, then wrap them around the pork, tucking the ends underneath.  
Arrange on a large roasting tin (you need one big enough to accomodate the rhubarb slices, too), drizzle with the oil, and place in an oven preheated to 190C/Fan 170C/gas Mark 5 for 30 minutes.

In the meantime, warm the honey in a pan on low heat, and toss the rhubarb to coat. After the 30 minutes for the pork, add the rhubarb to the roasting tin, and put back into the oven for a further 10 to 12 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender and the bacon is nice and browned.

Remove the pork and rhubarb from the roasting tin, keep warm and set aside for now, while you use the roasting tin drippings to make gravy:  
Set the roasting tin on the hob (or if your roasting dish isnâ€™t hob-safe, pour the liquid into the pot you used to warm the honey, making sure to scrape up all the oven drippings), pour in the stock, and bring to the boil. Allow to simmer for a few minutes, then stir in the crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, whisking quickly until itâ€™s dissolved into the sauce. Season to taste.

Cut the pork into slices to show off how fancy the layers look, pour a little sauce on top, arrange the rhubarb alongside, and wait for the compliments to roll in because this meal is amazing.

## My Notes
I doubled the recipe, and we reheated the leftovers the next day in the microwave, on 80% power gently until hot. It was a bit of a faff to prepare the meat but completely worth it. ðŸ™‚
