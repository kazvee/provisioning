# No Bake Rum Balls
Makes: about 36

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons cocoa  
2 cups confectioners sugar  
2 1/2 cups finely crushed vanilla or graham wafers (most of a 12 oz box!)  
1 cup finely chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)  
3 tablespoons light corn syrup  
1/4 cup dark (or dark spiced) rum or bourbon

## Directions
Into a large bowl, sift the cocoa and 1 cup of confectioners sugar. Mix in remaining ingredients. Form the mixture into 1-inch balls with your hands. Sprinkle about 1 cup confectioners sugar on a plate and roll the balls in it to coat.  
Store in a tin for at least 1 week before serving (I keep them in the fridge). They will mellow with age and will keep for up to 1 month.
