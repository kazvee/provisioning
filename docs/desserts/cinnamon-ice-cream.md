# Cinnamon Ice Cream

## Ingredients
2 cups (500 ml) whipping cream  
8 egg yolks  
3/4 cup (175 ml) granulated sugar  
3 – 4 teaspoons (15 – 20 ml) ground cinnamon, (or to taste)

## Directions
Place cream in small pot and heat until bubbles form around the edge. ln large glass bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg yolks with sugar for 3 – 4 minutes or until light and lemon-colored. Beat in the hot cream slowly, in a stream, until blended.  
Place the mixture in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture coats a spoon.  
Remove from heat, beat in the ground cinnamon, and let cool. Place in covered container in the freezer until firm.

## My Notes
Instead of cinnamon, you can use ground nutmeg, grated orange rind, or puréed fruits.
